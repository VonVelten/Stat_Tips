	abstract = {Breed differences and nonadditive genetic effects for milk production traits, somatic cell score (SCS), conception rate (CR), and days to first service (DFS) were estimated for Holstein × Montbéliarde and Holstein × Normande crossbreds, using an animal model adapted from the French genetic evaluation and extended to across-breed analysis. Inbreeding and breed differences were estimated from all purebred recorded cows. Only records from 1,137 herds with Holstein × Montbéliarde crossbred cows and from 1,033 herds with Holstein × Normande crossbred cows were used to estimate crossbreeding parameters. In these herds, crossbred cows represented about 13\% of the total number of recorded animals compared with {\textless}1\% when all herds were considered. Compared with the Montbéliarde and Normande breeds, the Holstein breed was genetically superior for production [+951kg and +2,444kg for 305-d mature-equivalent (305ME) milk, +40kg and +102kg for 305ME fat, +17kg and +54kg for 305ME protein, respectively] and inferior for fertility traits (−12 and −9\% for CR, respectively). Inbreeding depression caused loss of yield for production traits (from −32 to −41kg of 305ME milk, −1.4 to −1.7kg of 305ME fat, and −1.1 to −1.3kg of 305ME protein per inbreeding percentage), a small increase in SCS (+0.001 to 0.006) and DFS (+0.12d), and a decrease in CR (−0.27 to −0.44\%). Favorable heterosis effects were found for all traits (+494 to 524kg of 305ME milk, +21 to 22kg of 305ME fat, +15 to 16kg of 305ME protein, −0.05 to −0.04 SCS, +2 to 3\% for CR, and −3 to 6d of DFS), to such a point that F1 crossbreds could compete with Holstein cows for milk production while having a better fertility. However, recombination losses suggested that some F1 heterosis was lost for backcross cows.},

	abstract = {As oestrous expression of dairy cows has decreased over the last decades oestrus detection has become more difficult. The objective of this study is to identify the main factors that affect oestrus detection in seasonal calving dairy cows, and to establish their relative importance. In each of 5 years 36 Normande and 36 Holstein cows were assigned to a Low or High winter-feeding level group. Half of each group was then assigned to a Low or High pasture-feeding group. The Low–Low strategy resulted in the lowest milk yield and the greatest body condition (BC) loss from calving to nadir BC score (6302kg; −0.98unit). The High–High strategy had the converse effect (7549kg; −0.75units). Low–High and High–Low strategies had intermediate values. The Normande cows had lower milk yield and BC loss than Holstein cows (6153kg versus 7620kg; −0.82unit versus −1.20unit). A database of 415 observed spontaneous oestruses was created. Oestruses were classified according to detection signs: (1) standing to be mounted, (2) mounting without standing, (3) other signs without standing or mounting (slight signs). Presence of another cow in oestrus, access to pasture, Normande breed and Low–Low strategy increased standing detection. In the Normande breed, 97\% of oestruses were detected by standing while combining the presence of a herdmate in oestrus and access to pasture with a milk production of less than 6550kg. Holstein cows had a higher frequency of slight signs oestruses than Normande ones, which was associated with a decreased subsequent calving rate (P{\textless}0.05). In multiparous Holstein cows, the odds of slight signs detection was multiplied by 7.8 for the High–High group in comparison with the Low–Low group (P{\textless}0.05). In our study milk yield had an effect on oestrus detection which was not explained by BC loss. As High–High cows produced more milk than others, we logically found that an increase in milk yield increased slight signs detection. Conversely, as they lost less BC than others, BC loss improved the chance of standing or mounting detection. These two results show that an increase in milk yield may reduce oestrous behaviour even if BC loss is moderate. Oestrus detection is crucial in seasonal compact calving systems. High phenotypic milk yields appear unsuitable with such systems in regard to depressed oestrous behaviour.},

	abstract = {Subclinical hypocalcemia is considered a gateway disease that increases susceptibility to other metabolic and infectious diseases in transition dairy cows. In the absence of a cow-side test, however, it is difficult to identify hypocalcemic cows. The objective of this study was to evaluate ear skin temperature as a diagnostic predictor of serum calcium concentration. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 7 commercial dairy farms, involving 251 cows 0 to 48 h after calving. Skin temperature of the ears (STEar) was scored manually by palpating both ears. An infrared thermometer was used to measure ear temperature, skin temperature on the coxal tuber (STCox), and ambient temperature. Rectal temperature was measured using a digital thermometer. A blood sample was drawn to determine serum calcium concentration. Hypocalcemia was defined as serum calcium below 2.0 mmol/L, irrespective of clinical symptoms. Serum calcium concentration \&lt;2.0 mmol/L in connection with clinical symptoms was defined as clinical milk fever; serum calcium concentration \&lt;2.0 mmol/L without clinical symptoms was defined as subclinical hypocalcemia. Multivariate analysis using the GENLINMIXED procedure and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed to evaluate whether serum calcium concentration could be predicted using ear temperature and other temperature estimates. The prevalence of hypocalcemia was 3.3, 27.3, 32.8, and 69.6\% for cows in first, second, third, and fourth or greater lactation, respectively. None of the cows in first and second lactation had clinical milk fever. The prevalence of clinical milk fever was 6.0 and 20.3\% for cows in their third and fourth or greater lactation, respectively. A decrease in ear temperature of 0.39°C [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.25–0.54] was associated with a decrease of 0.1 mmol/L in serum calcium concentration. Ambient temperature, however, was a major confounder for ear temperature. With an increase in ambient temperature of 1°C, STEar rose by 0.78°C (95\% CI: 0.67–0.90). Hypothermia was more pronounced in clinical milk fever (median 21.8°C; interquartile range 14.7–27.0°C) compared with subclinical hypocalcemia (median 27.6°C, interquartile range 22.1–30.8°C). All temperature estimates had only accurate test characteristics based on their area under the curve for prediction of subclinical hypocalcemia (area under the curve for STEar, STCox, and rectal temperature were 0.641, 0.668, and 0.606, respectively) when cows with clinical milk fever were excluded. Although ear temperature has been associated with serum calcium concentration, ear temperature cannot be recommended for diagnosis of subclinical hypocalcemia.},

The cows were fed three amounts of P at either 100, 80 or 67\% of the Dutch P recommendation, actually resulting in dietary P concentrations of 3.2 to 3.9, 2.6 to 2.9 and 2.2 to 2.6 g P/kg dry matter during lactation for the three treatments, respectively. On the basis of plasma P values as low as 0.9 mmol/l and saliva P values as low as 5.1 mmol/l during the second lactation period within the experiment, the 67\% group was considered to be deficient in P. By decreasing milk production, and thus lowering P losses with milk, P retention in the 67\% group remained near zero. The P supply with the 80\% ration was considered to be just sufficient. At high milk yield and marginal dietary P concentrations, plasma P and saliva P concentrations were decreased. The higher P intake in high-compared with low-producing cows resulted in a constant absolute fecal P excretion, due to the fact that the apparent P digestibility was raised with increasing milk yield. There was a direct relationship between milk P output and the percentage of apparent P digestibility for individual animals.},

	abstract = {Inorganic orthophosphate (P-i) transport, using P-32-labelled orthophosphate as tracer, by lactating rat mammary tissue has been examined using both tissue explants and the intact perfused gland. P-i uptake was predominantly via a Na+-dependent pathway. Li+, however, unlike choline, was able to partially substitute for Na+ In addition, P-i release from tissue explants preloaded with (32)p(i) was stimulated by reversing the Na+ gradient. Thus transferring mammary explants from a buffer containing Na+ to one which was Na+ free (choline replacement) doubled the P-i efflux rate constant. The uptake of P-i by tissue explants was saturable with respect to external P-i, having apparent K-m and V-max values of 1.13 mM and 3.36 mmol (kg cell water)(-1) (15 min)(-1), respectively. The stimulation of P-i uptake by tissue explants by external Na+ was also saturable; the K-m for Na+ was 9.7 mM. These results, taken together, suggest that the Na+-dependent pathway is a Na+-P-i, cotransport mechanism. The transport of P-i by the perfused lactating rat mammary gland was examined using a rapid, paired tracer dilution technique. P-i uptake by the perfused gland was Found to be Na+ dependent and displayed saturable kinetics. The results suggest that the Na+-P-i, cotransporter is situated at the basolateral aspect of the secretory cells. The release of P-i from preloaded tissue explants was trans-accelerated by external P-i but not by Cl- or SO42-. However, external P-i stimulated P-i efflux with low affinity.},

Cows without signs of visible milk fever (n = 984) from 7 farms were blocked by parity and randomly assigned to receive either Ca gluconate (35\% wt/vol) in combination with Ca glucoheptonate (10\% wt/vol; TheraCalcium, Vétoquinol Canada Inc., Lavaltrie, Quebec) or a placebo (medication vehicle solution with no Ca) at first contact with each cow after calving and again 12 to 24 h later. Each dose was 120 mL injected subcutaneously over 2 sites. Total serum Ca concentration (tCa) was measured from coccygeal blood samples before (time 0) and 24 and 48 h after first treatment in a subsample of cows (n = 129). Blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured from all cows twice between 3 and 16 d in milk at weekly visits and cows were evaluated for vaginal discharge once between 28 and 42 d in milk. Disease events, production data from the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement milk tests, reproduction, and culling data were collected from each herd. For cows that had received 1 injection of Ca before the blood sample at 24 h (n = 95), tCa was significantly higher in the treated cows: mean ± standard error, 2.03 ± 0.03 versus 1.90 ± 0.03 mmol/L, accounting for tCa at time of enrollment and a treatment by tCa at enrollment interaction. At 48 h, no significant difference was found in tCa between treatment and control (mean ± SE, 2.12 ± 0.02 and 2.10 ± 0.03 mmol/L, respectively). Cows treated with the Ca product were significantly less likely to have received intravenous, subcutaneous, or oral supplemental Ca for exhibiting clinical signs of hypocalcemia than control cows (5.0 vs. 8.4\%). No effect was found of treatment on retained placenta, metritis, hyperketonemia, prevalence of purulent vaginal discharge, culling from the herd, early lactation production, probability of pregnancy to first artificial insemination, or time to pregnancy. With this subcutaneous prophylactic Ca treatment regimen, blood Ca levels were temporarily increased at 24 h after treatment, but no effect was observed of supplemental Ca on the risk of disease or culling, milk production, or reproductive performance.},

	abstract = {To meet the demands for milk calcium, the lactating mother adjusts systemic calcium and bone metabolism by increasing dietary calcium intake, increasing bone resorption, and reducing renal calcium excretion. As part of this adaptation, the lactating mammary gland secretes PTHrP into the maternal circulation to increase bone turnover and mobilize skeletal calcium stores. Previous data have suggested that, during lactation, the breast relies on the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) to coordinate PTHrP secretion and milk calcium transport with calcium availability. To test this idea genetically, we bred BLG-Cre mice with CaSR-floxed mice to ablate the CaSR specifically from mammary epithelial cells only at the onset of lactation (CaSR-cKO mice). Loss of the CaSR in the lactating mammary gland did not disrupt alveolar differentiation or milk production. However, it did increase the secretion of PTHrP into milk and decreased the transport of calcium from the circulation into milk. CaSR-cKO mice did not show accelerated bone resorption, but they did have a decrease in bone formation. Loss of the mammary gland CaSR resulted in hypercalcemia, decreased PTH secretion, and increased renal calcium excretion in lactating mothers. Finally, loss of the mammary gland CaSR resulted in decreased calcium accrual by suckling neonates, likely due to the combination of increased milk PTHrP and decreased milk calcium. These results demonstrate that the mammary gland CaSR coordinates maternal bone and calcium metabolism, calcium transport into milk, and neonatal calcium accrual during lactation.},

	abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be involved in calcium homeostasis, modulating calcium concentration in blood. In addition, 5-HT participates in a variety of metabolic pathways, mainly through the modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. The hypothesis of the present study was that the prepartum administration of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan (5-HTP), a 5-HT precursor, would affect endocrine systems related to calcium homeostasis, and interact with other endocrine and metabolic pathways during the transition period. In this study, 20 Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 2 experimental groups. Both groups received a daily i.v. infusion of 1 L of either 0.9\% NaCl (control group; n = 10) or 0.9\% NaCl containing 1 mg of 5-HTP/kg of BW (5-HTP group, n = 10). Infusions started d 10 before estimated parturition date and ended the day of parturition, resulting in a minimum of 4 d of infusion (8.4 ± 0.7 d of infusion). Until parturition, blood samples were collected before the daily infusions, and postpartum daily until d 7, and on d 30. Plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) were transiently increased at parturition and on d 1 in control cows. In the 5-HTP group PTH remained unchanged. The concentration of pyridinoline (PYD), an established marker for calcium release from the bone to the bloodstream, increased on d 1 postpartum only in the 5-HTP group. In control cows, PYD concentrations did not change on d 1 postpartum. Melatonin concentrations were slightly but significantly increased in the 5-HTP group compared with the control group. Insulin concentrations decreased in both groups postpartum. Before parturition, leptin concentrations decreased in both groups and remained at this level until d 30 postpartum. Plasma IgG concentrations decreased in both groups on d −1 postpartum. Haptoglobin increased in both groups on d −1 and remained at this level until d 7 postpartum. No differences between groups were observed for insulin, glucagon, IgG, leptin, adiponectin, and haptoglobin concentrations. The results obtained in the present study evidenced that 5-HT is regulating calcium homeostasis independent of PTH. The lack of treatment effects on IgG and on other hormones and metabolites indicates that 5-HTP did not affect these other metabolic pathways and the IgG concentration during the transition period.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of decreasing dietary cation-anion difference [DCAD; (Na+ + K+) − (Cl− + S2−)] of the prepartum diet on aspects of mineral metabolism, energy metabolism, and performance of peripartum dairy cows. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 89) were enrolled between 38 and 31 d before expected parturition and randomized to treatments in a completely randomized design (restricted to balance for previous 305-d mature equivalent milk production, parity, and body condition score) at 24 d before expected parturition. Treatments consisted of a low-K ration without anion supplementation [CON; n = 30, DCAD = +18.3 mEq/100 g of dry matter (DM)]; partial anion supplementation to a low-K ration (MED; n = 30, DCAD = +5.9 mEq/100 g of DM); and anion supplementation to a low-K ration to reach a targeted average urine pH between 5.5 and 6.0 (LOW; n = 29, DCAD = −7.4 mEq/100 g of DM). Cows were fed a common postpartum diet and data collected through 63 d in milk. Urine pH (CON = 8.22, MED = 7.89, and LOW = 5.96) was affected quadratically by decreasing prepartum DCAD. A linear relationship between urine pH and urine Ca:creatinine ratio was observed (r = −0.81). Plasma Ca concentrations in the postpartum period (d 0 to 14; CON = 2.16, MED = 2.19, and LOW = 2.27 mmol/L) were increased linearly with decreasing prepartum DCAD. A treatment by parity (second vs. third and greater) interaction for postpartum plasma Ca concentration suggested that older cows had the greatest response to the low DCAD diet and older cows fed LOW had decreased prevalence of hypocalcemia after calving. A quadratic effect of decreasing DCAD on prepartum DMI was observed (CON = 13.6, MED = 14.0, and LOW = 13.2 kg/d). Milk production in the first 3 wk postpartum was increased linearly with decreasing DCAD (CON = 40.8, MED = 42.4, and LOW = 43.9 kg/d) and DMI in this period also tended to linearly increase (CON = 20.2, MED = 20.9, and LOW = 21.3 kg/d). Overall, effects on intake and milk yield analyzed over wk 1 to 9 postpartum were not significant. This study demonstrates that feeding lower DCAD diets prepartum improves plasma Ca status in the immediate postpartum period and results in increased DMI and milk production in the 3 wk after parturition. Compared with no anion supplementation or lower levels of anion supplementation, greater improvements were observed with the lower DCAD feeding strategy, in which an average urine pH of 5.5 to 6.0 was targeted.},

	abstract = {In our previous study, it was demonstrated that the administration of anion salts, which slightly lower the dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD), in the prepartum period is safe and effective for preventing milk fever in multiparous cows. In the present study, several biomarkers, which might show activation of Ca metabolism, were analyzed using stored samples in the previous study to investigate the mechanism of the preventive effect on milk fever by lowering DCAD. Changes in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin and insulin-like growth factor I concentrations in serum were almost the same among the three groups of multiparous cows with or without the oral administration of anion salts, while the levels of these serum biomarkers in the group of primiparous cows (heifer group) were much higher compared with those in the three multiparous groups throughout the experimental period. Urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion was not a useful biomarker for dairy cows because it hardly changed during the peripartum period in all groups. However, serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, which is known as a biomarker of osteoclast activity, was well associated with the administration of anion salts lowering DCAD because among the three multiparous groups, only the group of multiparous cows fed the anion salts (anion group) showed an increased level, which rose to the level in the heifer group, and was markedly higher than those in the other control groups of multiparous cows. The increased activity of serum TRAP in the anion group suggested that Ca in the plasma pool was mobilized smoothly from bone-bound Ca via mature osteoclasts at parturition, which might be due to prior activation under mild acidosis induced by slightly lowering DCAD. Therefore, TRAP was the best biomarker to monitor the activation of Ca metabolism in dairy cows fed anion salts.},

	abstract = {Pregnancy and lactation both place significant demands on the mother to provide sufficient calcium (among other minerals and nutrients) to the fetus and neonate. Despite facing similar demands for calcium during pregnancy and lactation, the maternal adaptations differ significantly between these two reproductive periods. Women lose 300 to 400 mg of calcium daily through breast milk, and this calcium demand is met by a 5–10\% loss of skeletal mineral content during 6 months of exclusive lactation. Most importantly, the lost mineral is fully restored within a few months of weaning, such that women who have breastfed do not have a long-term deficit in skeletal mineral content. This article will review our present understanding of the adaptations in mineral metabolism that occur during pregnancy and lactation, and will focus on recent evidence that the breast itself plays a central role in regulating the adaptations during lactation.},

	abstract = {Experiments were carried out in vivo and in vitro to study the flux of Ca2+ across the sheep rumen wall. Buffer solutions with five different Ca2+, concentrations in the range 0·2-3·6 mmol l−1 were introduced into the isolated, emptied and washed reticulo-rumen for 1 h to determine Ca2+ net flux. Phosphate concentrations were either kept constant at 8 mmol l−1, or varied so as to maintain a constant phosphate/Ca2+ ratio of 2:1. Under both conditions there was a Ca2+ net secretion into the rumen at Ca2+ concentrations below approximately 1 mmol l−1 whereas Ca2+ net absorption occurred at higher Ca2+ concentrations and linearly increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations. When phosphate concentrations were reduced to 4·3 and 0·6 mmol l−1 (Ca2+, 3 mmol l−1) Ca2+ net absorption was reduced by about 50\% and completely abolished, respectively. The unidirectional (mucosal-to-serosal or serosal-to-mucosal) Ca fluxes in vitro, JCams and JCasm, were measured in Ussing chambers with computer-controlled voltage clamp. Under short-circuit current conditions (Ca2+ and phosphate, 2 mmol l−1) there was a significant net flux of Ca2+ from the mucosal to the serosal side. This net flux of Ca2+ was abolished when ouabain was added to the serosal solution, indicating that the unidirectional Ca2+ flux JCams and, hence, the net flux of Ca2+ was dependent upon active Na+ transport accomplished by the Na, K-ATPase system. Under voltage clamp conditions, the net flux of Ca2+ was greatly increased at a potential difference PD = -25 mV (serosa negative) but disappeared at PD = +25 mV (serosa positive). Analysis of the unidirectional Ca2+ fluxes JCams and JCasm under varying potential differences indicated that both Ca2+ fluxes consisted of a PD-dependent and a PD-independent component. The results show that the reticulo-rumen participates in Ca2+ absorption in sheep.},

One hundred winter-calving Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were offered diets containing either 'high' or 'low' levels of dietary P over a 4-year period. Rations offered during the winter included grass silage, maize silage (70 : 30 dry matter (DM) basis, approximately) and concentrates (10.0 to 12.0 kg/cow per day). During the summer periods in years 1 and 2, half of the cows grazed both day and night, while the remaining cows grazed by day, and were housed by night and offered grass silage. During years 3 and 4, all cows grazed both day and night during the summer period. Concentrate feed levels during the summer periods were 3.0 to 4.0 kg/cow per day. Different dietary P levels were achieved by offering concentrates containing either high or low P levels during the winter period (approximately 7.0 or 4.4 g P/kg DM, respectively) and during the summer period (approximately 6.8 or 3.6 g P/kg DM, respectively). Total ration P levels averaged 4.9 and 3.6 g P/kg DM for the high and low P winter diets, respectively, and 4.2 and 3.6 g P/kg DM for the high and low P summer diets, respectively. A total of 95, 70, 50 and 22 cows completed each of lactations from 1 to 4, respectively. Neither the incidence of lameness or mastitis, or milk somatic cell count, were affected by dietary P level (P {\textgreater} 0.05), while none of the fertility parameters recorded in any of lactations from 1 to 4 was affected by the dietary P level (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Dietary P level had no effect on the specific gravity, ash or calcium content of rib cortical bone cores (n = 78 cows), while the P content of cortical bone (g/kg fresh, g/kg DM and mg/ml fresh bone) was lower with cows offered low P diets (P {\textless} 0.05). Dietary P level had no significant effect on the digestibility of either the DM, nitrogen, energy or acid detergent fibre fraction of the diet (P {\textgreater} 0.05), while faecal P excretions were reduced by a mean of 27 g/cow per day with cows offered the low P diets during the winter period. The results of this study indicate that dietary P levels can be reduced to proportionately 0.8 (approximately) of current UK feeding standards (Agricultural and Food Research Council, 1991), with no detrimental effect on dairy cow health or fertility, while having only minor effects on bone composition.},

The aims of this study were to describe throughout the year the changes in bulk milk compounds and to relate them to husbandry practices. Ten compounds with nutritional requirements were selected: a minimum amount is required for Ca, Mg, P, Zn, vitamin A, n-3 fatty acids (FA), oleic acid and n-6 FA, and a maximum amount for trans FA and C12–14-16 FA. Milks and their associated husbandry practices were collected five times during 1 year from 74 groups of farms located in France, Norway, Slovakia and Slovenia. The Ca, Mg, P and Zn contents varied in different ways throughout the year and independently of each other. We showed the absence of milks with the highest contents in these four minerals simultaneously, but we identified groups of farms where milk had high content in Mg or in Zn. Positive links have been confirmed between grass-based-diets and milk n-3 FA content, maize silage-based-diets and n-6 FA content, and diets rich in concentrate and oleic acid content. These results showed that it was possible to identify husbandry conditions leading to milk favourable throughout the year for one or several compounds but not for all compounds considered in this study.},

	abstract = {Background
Bovine milk provides important minerals, essential for human nutrition and dairy product quality. For changing the mineral composition of the milk to improve dietary needs in human nutrition and technological properties of milk, a thorough understanding of the genetics underlying milk mineral contents is important. Therefore the aim of this study was to 1) estimate the genetic parameters for individual minerals in Danish Holstein (DH) (n = 371) and Danish Jersey (DJ) (n = 321) milk, and 2) detect genomic regions associated with mineral content in the milk using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach.

Results
For DH, high heritabilities were found for Ca (0.72), Zn (0.49), and P (0.46), while for DJ, high heritabilities were found for Ca (0.63), Zn (0.57), and Mg (0.57). Furthermore, intermediate heritabilities were found for Cu in DH, and for K, Na, P and Se in the DJ. The GWAS revealed a total of 649 significant SNP markers detected for Ca (24), Cu (90), Fe (111), Mn (3), Na (1), P (4), Se (12) and Zn (404) in DH, while for DJ, a total of 787 significant SNP markers were detected for Ca (44), Fe (43), K (498), Na (4), Mg (1), P (94) and Zn (3). Comparing the list of significant markers between DH and DJ revealed that the SNP ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939 was common in both breeds for Zn. This SNP marker is closely linked to the DGAT1 gene. Even though we found significant SNP markers on BTA14 in both DH and DJ for Ca, and Fe these significant SNPs did not overlap.

Conclusion
The results show that Ca, Zn, P and Mg show high heritabilities. In combination with the GWAS results this opens up possibilities to select for specific minerals in bovine milk.

	abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is found in very high concentrations in the milk of various mammals. However, little is known about its physiological role in this fluid. To obtain detailed profiles of PTHrP in milk, we measured the concentrations of PTHrP in human milk by two different region-specific assays, PTHrP(1-87) (N-PTHrP) and PTHrP(109-141) (C-PTHrP). We also examined the correlations between PTHrP and Ca concentrations in milk as well as the correlations between PTHrP and secreted milk volume. The levels of N-PTHrP and C-PTHrP were relatively low after delivery and gradually increased to 13.87 +/- 2.40 nmol/l (mean +/- S.E.M.) and 56.39 +/- 11.31 nmol/l respectively on the 10th day postpartum. N-PTHrP concentration remained steady until the 6th month postpartum when weaning starts, at which point it decreased slightly. C-PTHrP levels changed in a similar way to N-PTHrP levels but were 2- to 5-fold higher. Milk Ca concentration, and content, correlated with C-PTHrP concentration, and content (r = 0.422 and r = 0.769 respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001) but not with N-PTHrP. N-PTHrP concentration in the milk samples on the 4th day postpartum correlated with the volume of milk secreted during the 24 h before the samples were taken (r = 0.524, P {\textless} 0.01), but C-PTHrP concentration did not. These results suggest that PTHrP in human milk may play some role in the maintenance of lactation through the N-terminal region and in promoting Ca transfer into milk via the C-terminal region.},

	abstract = {Lactating mammals must supply large amounts of calcium to the mammary gland where it is transported across mammary epithelial cells and into milk. This demand for calcium is associated with transient loss of bone mass, triggered, in part, by the secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) from the mammary gland into the circulation. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals in response to extracellular calcium ions. It is responsible for coordinating calcium homeostasis by regulating parathyroid hormone secretion in the parathyroid glands and by regulating calcium handling in the renal tubules. Previous studies had shown that the CaR is expressed on mammary epithelial cells during lactation, and it had been suggested that CaR signaling in the mammary gland helps to coordinate its production of PTHrP and calcium transport into milk. In this study, we examined mammary gland PTHrP production and calcium transport in CaR+/− mice, a genetic model of CaR insufficiency. We found that haploinsufficiency for the CaR resulted in increased PTHrP production both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, CaR haploinsufficiency impaired calcium transport into milk in vivo and transepithelial calcium transport by mammary epithelial cells in vitro. These data provide genetic confirmation that the CaR regulates PTHrP production and calcium transport in the lactating mammary gland. This allows the mammary gland to become a calcium-sensing organ and to participate in systemic calcium homeostasis during lactation.},

Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

	abstract = {As part of a study of seasonal variations in chemical composition of pasture herbage Ca, Mg, K, and Na concentrations, and the ratios K/(Ca + Mg) and Ca/P, were determined by monthly samplings at seven sites in the lower North Island. Grass and clover components were harvested separately at six sites, and grasses, clovers, and “other species” (herbs) at the seventh. Sub-plots were harvested by hand shears, after which sheep were allowed to graze before the plots were enclosed until the next sampling date. The seasonal patterns in herbage chemical composition were similar at all sites despite wide differences in soil, climate, and dry matter production. For Ca, the highest values occurred in summer and the lowest in mid winter. Calcium concentrations were higher, and the variations greater, in clovers than in grasses, and concentrations were even higher in “other species”. Trends in Mg were seasonally similar to those for Ca but were much less pronounced; and differences between grasses and clovers were generally small. Potassium showed marked monthly fluctuations which were generally similar in the grass and clover components suggesting an effect of stock urine. High levels occcurred in late winter, with a peak in early spring, and the lowest levels in early bummer. There were no clear trends in Na concentrations, which were generally quite high in both grasses and clovers. Very high levels in “other species” occurred in late autumn to early spring. The K/(Ca + Mg) ratio (in chemical equivalents) in the grass component generally remained above the proposed critical level of 2.2 for 3–4 months at most sites during the winter and early spring, indicating a possible grass tetany hazard. On the other hand, the Ca/P ratio (in percentages) tended to fluctuate about the suggested “ideal” value of 1.5. The results were generally in accord with data from previous investigations on New Zealand pastures.},

Three stocking rates, designated control (C: 2·3 cows/ha over the total area of the system), moderate (M: 2·6 cows/ha = 115\% of C) and high (H: 3·0 cows/ha = 130\% of C), were compared at two rates of concentrate supplement, 3·7 kg/cow per day and 0·5 kg/cow per day. Individual milk yield differed by a non-significant 5\% between the extreme stocking rates (21·3 v. 20·3 kg fat-corrected milk (FCM) for treatments C and H, respectively). Milk production/ha was 23\% greater in the H treatment (9816 v. 7970 kg FCM for H and C, respectively).

Twenty-two multiparous cows of the Swedish Red and White Breed were included in the experiment. Eleven cows received a dietary P concentration of 0.43\% of DM during the whole lactation (NP), and 11 cows received a dietary P concentration of 0.32\% of DM during the first 4 months of lactation, followed by 0.43\% of DM during the rest of lactation (LP). Total collection of faeces was carried out during five different stages of lactation, for 5 consecutive days at each occasion. The dynamics of bone metabolism was investigated by monitoring one bone-formation marker, identifying osteocalcin (OC), and one bone-resorption marker identifying C-telopeptide fragments of collagen type I (CTx) in blood plasma. At the two first collection periods, 3–7 and 11–15 weeks after parturition, the apparent digestibility of P was higher in the LP cows (52\%) than in the NP cows (42\%). During the following collection periods, no difference in the apparent digestibility could be noted between the two groups of cows. Phosphorus retention did not differ between treatments at any collection period. The highest retention was observed during late lactation and during the dry period. The profiles of the bone metabolism markers indicated a net resorption of bone during early lactation, but there were no differences in marker concentrations between the groups during early lactation, indicating that the LP diet did not induce a further elevated net bone resorption.},

	abstract = {Three supplemental sources of inorganic calcium (calcite flour, aragonite, albacar), each differing in particle size and rate of reactivity, provided .6 or .9\% calcium in corn silage:grain (1:1 dry matter) diets of high producing dairy cows. All cows were fed calcite flour at .6\% calcium during the first 4 wk of lactation. On d 29 of lactation 5 cows were assigned to each of the six diets. Peak milk yield paralleled dry matter intake and was 1) higher when calcite flour and aragonite provided .9\% calcium, 2) intermediate when all sources provided .6\% calcium, and 3) lower when albacar provided .9\% calcium. However, adaptations to calcium source and to particle sizes of a calcium source (.35 to 1190μ) were made within 40 d by lactating Holsteins. Starch increased and pH decreased in feces of cows fed albacar. Increasing calcium in the diet provided more buffering capacity in the gastrointestinal tract. True absorption of calcium did not differ from linearity due to source when fecal calcium was regressed on ingested calcium but did vary as a function of diet percentage. Thus, calcium retention was increased when cows were fed .9 vs. .6\% calcium. These data suggest that a slow reacting (coarser) inorganic calcium source should be fed at a higher amount to optimize feed intake and milk production.},

	abstract = {Dairy cow bone phosphorus (P) mobilization and deposition and their influence on P requirements were studied over the lactation cycle. Thirty Holsteins received a common diet during the dry period and one of the following three dietary treatments that varied in P percentage during the subsequent lactation (44 weeks): (i) 0.36 throughout (constant P, 0.36-0.36-0.36), (ii) 0.36 for 30 weeks then 0.29 for 14 weeks (P changed once, 0.36-0.36-0.29), and (iii) 0.43 for 10 weeks, 0.36 for 20 weeks, and 0.29 for 14 weeks (P changed twice, 0.43-0.36-0.29). Six P balance studies were conducted during the experiment, including one during the dry period and five along lactation, based on P intake, faecal P, urinary P and milk P, when appropriate. Blood samples were taken during balance to analyse bone formation (osteocalcin) and resorption (pyridinoline) marker concentrations and rib biopsies performed to determine bone P content. Phosphorus balance was negative during weeks −4 to −1 relative to lactation for all groups and remained negative for cows fed 0.36\% P during weeks 1–5, but showed a positive value for cows that received 0.43\% P. The balance was close to zero for all groups at weeks 19–23 and showed a clear retention during weeks 38–42; by the end of lactation, cows re-stored most of the P mobilized earlier. The pattern in P balance was consistent with changes in blood bone metabolism marker concentrations, rib bone P content, and faecal and urinary P concentrations over the experiment, indicating that cows, irrespective of the dietary P treatments received, mobilized P from bone during the late dry period when fed a low-Ca diet and early lactation, and re-stored P in late lactation. This dynamic of P metabolism can have important implications for dietary P requirements and ration formulations.},

	abstract = {Mineral balance and radioisotope studies have been carried out to test the adequacy of recent Agricultural Research Council (1980) recommendations for calcium and phosphorus for pregnant and lactating ewes. At the same time, Ca metabolism was compared throughout pregnancy and lactation in ewes restricted to these recommendations and in ewes given a plentiful supply of dietary Ca and P. Irrespective of their Ca intake, ewes were unable to absorb enough dietary Ca in late pregnancy and early lactation to meet the high demands, and skeletal stores of Ca were mobilized to make good the deficit. Whereas ewes given the plentiful intake absorbed enough dietary Ca in mid- to late lactation to replace their lost skeletal Ca stores, ewes given the restricted Ca and P intake did not and, at the end of lactation, were still in deficit of about 10\% of their total body Ca. Since Ca absorption in the restricted ewes occurred at the maximum efficiency (66\%) expected from a hay and concentrates diet, the Agricultural Research Council (1980) recommendations for Ca, particularly in mid-to late lactation, must be inadequate. It is suggested that in calculating requirements, allowance must be made for the inevitable loss and subsequent replacement of skeletal stores. The endogenous faecal loss of Ca was found to vary in direct relation to the food intake, and the significance of this finding to calculations of Ca requirements is discussed.},

	abstract = {Calcium (Ca) balance is the net of Ca intake and output from the body over a period of time. The concept of Ca balance does not consider the redistribution of Ca that often occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those who are on dialysis, which is often in the form of soft tissue and/or vascular calcification. In this article, we consider movement of Ca with respect to the extracellular fluid (ECF) and develop a mathematical formulation for Ca homeostasis with respect to the ECF that includes input and output from the diet, the bone, the kidney, and dialysis. We consider calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals and in patients with excess parathyroid hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), and metabolic acidosis; patients who have CKD and are not on dialysis; and, finally, patients who have CKD and are on dialysis. On the basis of a number of assumptions, dialysis patients with a daily intake of {\textgreater}37.5 mmol of elemental Ca (1.5 g) have movement of Ca into the ECF even without supplemental activated vitamin D. Addition of activated vitamin D, which increases intestinal Ca absorption and can increase resorption of Ca from bone, leads to the movement of Ca into the ECF at virtually all levels of intake; however, there are numerous unanswered questions regarding Ca homeostasis in patients with CKD, including how much of the Ca, administered as a phosphate binder, is absorbed and what is the fate of this absorbed Ca. Until these pressing questions are answered with well-designed experiments, we do not know whether we are doing more harm than good for our dialysis patients by administering additional Ca as a phosphate binder, especially when they also receive activated vitamin D.},

	abstract = {The INRA Feeding System for Ruminants has been renewed to better address emerging challenges for animal nutrition: prevision of productive responses, product quality, animal health and emissions to the environment, in a larger extent of breeding contexts. The new system is mainly built from meta-analyses of large data bases, and modelling. The dietary supply model accounts for digestive interactions and flows of individual nutrients, so that feed values depend on the final ration. Animal requirements account for variability in metabolic efficiency. Various productive and non-productive animal responses to diets are quantified. This book presents the whole system for dairy and meat, large and small ruminant production, including specificities for tropical and Mediterranean areas. The first two sections present biological concepts and equations (with their field of application and statistical accuracy) used to predict intake (including at grazing) and nutrient supply (Section 1), animal’s requirements and multiple responses to diets (Section 2). They apply to net energy, metabolisable protein and amino acids, water, minerals and vitamins. Section 3 presents the use of concepts and equations in rationing with two purposes: (1) diet calculation for a given performance objective; and (2) prediction of the multiple responses of animal to diet changes. Section 4 displays the tables of feed values, and their prevision. All the equations and concepts are embedded in the fifth version of INRAtion® software  for practical use.},

	abstract = {This review considers the current literature on the macro-mineral nutrition of the soon-to-calve, or transition, dairy cow. Calcium is the main focus, since milk fever (clinical hypocalcaemia) appears to be the most common mineral-related problem faced by the transition cow Australia-wide. The importance of minimising calcium intake and optimising the balance of the key dietary electrolytes, sodium, potassium, sulfate, and chloride, in the weeks before calving is highlighted. Excess dietary potassium can, in some situations, induce milk fever, perhaps even more effectively than excess calcium. Excess sodium remains under suspicion. In contrast, excess dietary chlorine and, to a lesser extent, sulfur can improve the ability of the cow to maintain calcium homeostasis. Diets that promote either a hypomagnesaemia or hyperphosphataemia have also the potential to precipitate milk fever at calving. Current prevention strategies focus on the use of forages with moderate to low levels of calcium, potassium, and sodium, and also rely on or utilise addition of chloride and sulfate in the form of 'anionic' feeds. Anionic salts are one example of an anionic feed. However, legitimate questions remain as to the effectiveness of anionic salts in pasture-feeding systems. The causes and prevention of milk fever are considered from the perspective of the variety of Australian feedbases. Impediments to the use of anionic feeds in Australia feeding systems are outlined. The potential for improving maternal reserves of calcium around calving to reduce the risk of milk fever is also discussed.},

Experimental evidence indicates that the fluctuation of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum provides a pivotal and physiological role for cell proliferation. Ca(2+) depletion in the endoplasmatic reticulum triggers Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane in an phenomenon called store-operated calcium entries (SOCEs). SOCE is activated through a complex interplay between a Ca(2+) sensor, denominated STIM, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and a Ca(2+) channel at the cell membrane, denominated Orai.

PTHrP-(1-36) appears to be one of several secretory forms of PTHrP. This peptide has been administered iv to normal volunteers previously and has been shown to produce effects that are qualitatively and quantitatively the same as those produced by PTH-(1-34). To determine whether PTHrP-(1-36) could be used sc in humans as a diagnostic reagent for elucidating the differences between HHM and hyperparathyroidism, we performed a 12-h dose-finding study examining whether sc PTHrP-(1-36) could elicit effects on mineral homeostasis. PTHrP-(1-36) administered sc in three doses (0.82, 1.64, and 3.28 micrograms/kg) to 21 normal women produced increases in circulating PTHrP-(1-36), reductions in serum phosphorus and the renal phosphorus threshold, increments in fractional calcium excretion and nephrogenous cAMP excretion, and increases in plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. These changes were highly significant in statistical terms and were observed at doses that had no effect on serum calcium or endogenous PTH. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of using PTHrP-(1-36) as a diagnostic probe for future studies aimed at elucidating the differing pathophysiologies of HHM and hyperparathyroidism.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum leptin and body condition score (BCS) during the postpartum period in Holstein cows. We also explored the potential associations with other metabolic traits and fertility parameters. Primiparous and multiparous cows were subjected to leptin analysis on calving day. Starting at the second week postpartum, cows underwent seven weeks of weekly monitoring of serum concentrations of NEFA, BHB, leptin, cholesterol, AST, and bilirubin. During study, BCS changes were recorded, and the genital tract was assessed by ultrasonography and some fertility parameters were evaluated. During the study period, primiparous cows showed a lower mean BCS (P {\textless} 0.05). Leptin concentrations between calving and 8 weeks postpartum were higher in multiparous cows than primiparous cows (P {\textless} 0.001). Between postpartum weeks 2 and 8, primiparous cows showed higher concentrations of NEFA, BHB, and AST and lower cholesterol concentrations. Multiparous cows showed greater largest follicle diameters and ovulated earlier. Primiparous cows showed higher intervals of calving-to-first insemination and calving-to-conception, more insemination indices for the conception. Improved cow metabolic and reproductive performance was associated with lower concentrations of NEFA, BHB, and AST; higher concentrations of leptin and cholesterol; and greater BCS change during the early postpartum period. Delayed ovarian activity in primiparous cows might be caused by lower postpartum concentrations of leptin and cholesterol.},

An experiment was conducted over 9 yr on Normande and Holstein cows assigned to contrasted FS. Diets were based on maize silage in winter and grazing plus concentrate in spring in the high FS group, and on grass silage in winter and grazing with no concentrate during spring in the low FS group. Within breeds, cows were classified into 2 groups with similar estimated breeding values (EBV) for milk solids: cows with high EBV for milk yield were included in a milk group and those with high EBV for fat and protein contents were included in a content group. Holstein cows produced more milk throughout lactation than Normande cows (the differential was greater in the high FS group, +2,294 kg, compared with +1,280 kg in the low FS group) and lost more body condition to nadir (the differential was greater in the high FS group, −1.00 point, compared with −0.80 point in the low FS group). Within breeds, milk solids production was similar between genetic groups. Cows in the high FS group produced more milk (+2,495 kg for Holstein and +1,481 kg for Normande cows) and had a higher body condition score at nadir (+0.40 point for Holstein and +0.60 point for Normande) than cows in the low FS group. Holstein cows had a lower recalving rate than Normande cows (−19 percentage units). We found no effect of genetic group and FS on fertility of Normande cows. However, according to FS, Holstein cows in the content group exhibited different fertility failure patterns. In the low FS group, Holstein cows in the content group had more nonfertilizations or early embryo mortality (+26 percentage units at first and second services) than Holstein cows in the milk group. In the high FS group, Holstein cows in the content group had a higher proportion of late embryo mortality than in the milk group (+10 percentage units at first and second services). We observed no effect of FS on recalving rate; however, indicators of energy balance (protein content or body condition score) were positively associated with successful conception and pregnancy. This suggested a link between genetic merit for fat and protein content and lower ability of dairy cows to ensure pregnancy because of more nonfertilizations and early or late embryo mortality.},

	abstract = {The dairy farming systems of Western Europe are based on a simple feeding system composed of grazed and preserved grass, maize silage and concentrates in variable proportions. There is, nevertheless, a great diversity of feeding strategies between dairy farms. Over 5 years, we studied the direct and delayed effects of four feeding strategies on the lactation and reproduction performances of Holstein and Normande dairy cows. The four feeding strategies (denoted Hh, Hl, Lh and Ll) correspond to two total mixed rations applied in winter from calving to turnout (maize silage with 30\% concentrate or grass silage with 15\% concentrate), which were subsequently crossed with two levels of concentrate supplementation at grazing to 210 days. Each year, 72 dairy cows managed in grouped winter calving were assigned to the four strategies. Finally, the results of 325 lactations and 295 inseminated cows were analysed. The four strategies resulted in considerable variation in nutrient intake and, in particular, in differences in concentrates consumed, with values of 1407, 1026, 773 and 392 kg dry matter per cow for strategies Hh, Lh, Hl and Ll, respectively. Total milk production (7567, 7015, 6720 and 6238 kg per cow for treatments Hh, Lh, Hl and Ll, respectively), milk fat content (39.0, 37.1, 40.3 and 38.5 g/kg, respectively), milk protein content (33.0, 31.8, 33.1 and 31.6 g/kg, respectively), and the character of the lactation and body condition curves were all highly sensitive to the strategies applied. While no significant interaction was detected on total lactation yield, the Holstein cows reacted more dramatically to each dietary change at each period, compared with the Normande cows. Winter feeding did not affect the production of milk at pasture whereas, at pasture, the milk from the cows of the H groups in winter was higher in milk fat and protein content. Reproduction performance was unaffected by feeding strategy. The Holstein cows, well fed and producing the most milk (Hh and Hb), had the lowest rate of success at first artificial inseminations (21.5\%). The dual-purpose Normande cows had a pregnancy rate 10 points higher than Holstein cows. This comparison of strongly contrasting feeding strategies confirms the immediate reactivity of dairy cows (in terms of milk performance and body condition) to variations of nutritive intake throughout lactation, with a weak carryover effect from feeding levels early in lactation. In contrast, reproduction performance was less sensitive to variation in nutrient supply.},

	abstract = {Six ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were used to evaluate the effect of 2 dietary buffers on rumen pH, milk production, milk composition, and rumen fermentation parameters. A high concentrate total mixed ration [35.2\% forage dry matter (DM)], formulated to be potentially acidotic, was used to construct 3 dietary treatments in which calcareous marine algae (calcified remains of the seaweed Lithothamnium calcareum) was compared with limestone (control) and sodium bicarbonate plus limestone. One basal diet was formulated and the treatment diets contained either 0.4\% of dietary DM as Acid Buf, a calcified marine algae product (AB treatment), or 0.8\% of dietary DM as sodium bicarbonate and 0.37\% as limestone (BC treatment), or 0.35\% of dietary DM as limestone [control (CON) treatment]. Cows were randomly allocated to treatments according to a double 3×3 Latin square design, with 3 treatments and 3 periods. The total experimental period was 66 d during which each cow received each treatment for a period of 15 d before the data collection period of 7 d. Rumen fluid was collected to determine volatile fatty acids, lactic acid, and ammonia concentrations. Rumen pH was monitored every 10min for 2 consecutive days using a portable data logging system fitted with in-dwelling electrodes. Milk samples were analyzed for solid and mineral contents. The effect of treatment on acidity was clearly visible, especially from the period from midday to midnight when rumen pH dropped below 5.5 for a longer period of time (13 h) in the CON treatment than in the BC (8.7 h) and AB (4 h) treatments. Daily milk, 4\% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk yields differed among treatments, with AB being the highest, followed by BC and CON. Both buffers increased milk fat content. Treatment had no effect on milk protein content, but protein yield was increased in the AB treatment. Total rumen volatile fatty acids and acetate concentrations were higher and propionate was lower in the AB treatment than in CON. The molar proportion of acetate was higher in AB than in CON, but that of propionate was lower in both buffer treatments than in CON. The acetate:propionate ratio was increased in the AB and BC treatments compared with CON. Lactic acid concentration was higher in the CON treatment than in the buffer treatments. Treatment had no effect on rumen ammonia concentrations. Results indicated that buffer inclusion in high concentrate diets for lactating dairy cows had a positive effect on milk production and milk composition. Calcareous marine algae, at a level of 90 g/cow per day, had a greater effect on rumen pH, milk production and milk composition, and efficiency of feed conversion into milk than sodium bicarbonate at a level of 180 g/cow per day.},

	abstract = {Milk production was measured and phosphorus (P) excretion in feces was estimated in dairy cows fed three amounts of P. A basal diet was formulated to contain 0.31\% P (DM basis). Sodium monophosphate replaced corn in the basal diet to give two additional diets containing 0.40 and 0.49\% P. The diets were fed to eight, nine, and nine multiparous Holsteins from the beginning to the end of lactation. Milk yields for the 308-d lactation were 10,790, 11,226, and 11,134 kg for the three treatments, respectively. The lowest milk yield resulted from decreased milk production during late lactation with the 0.31\% P group. Reproductive performance of the cows was not related to dietary P content. Fecal P concentration, determined in wk 2, 4, 6, 8, 23, and 40 of lactation, increased as dietary P intake was increased. Cows fed the lowest P diet conserved P by minimizing P excretion in feces and urine, whereas cows in the other two treatments excreted more P through these routes. A reduction in dietary P from 0.49 to 0.40\% reduced fecal P excretion by 23\%. Apparent P digestibilities of less than 40\% are indicative of surplus dietary P. Feeding 0.40\% P appeared sufficient to maintain P balance and the level of milk production achieved in this experiment. An example is given which illustrates the relationship between dietary and fecal P.},

At the end of the experiment, a section (∼20 cm) of the 12th rib was surgically removed. The bone was tested for strength and analyzed for ash and P content. The shear strength and the energy required to deform the bone to the point of fracture did not differ among treatments. Bone specific gravities were 1.50, 1.57, and 1.55 for the three treatments. Ash and P content of the bone, measured in wet weight, dry weight, and wet bone volume, were similar for the 0.39 and 0.47\% P treatments, but tended to be lower with the 0.31\% P treatment. Milk production of cows in all groups was high, averaging \&gt;11,900 kg for the 308-d lactation.

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient and significant safety margins have until now been included in both feeding recommendations for cattle and allocation of P in practice. However, there is a need to optimize the utilization of P in cattle and thereby minimize its allocation and excretion. This demands well-defined requirements and availabilities of P in feeds as well as fairly precise use of this knowledge in practice. The purpose of this paper is to review the current knowledge and to give proposals for feeding phosphorus to cattle in relation to physiological requirement, availability of phosphorus in feeds, and minimal excretion of P. There is scientific and practical basis for a reduction of recommendations and allocation of P to cattle in the Nordic countries. No evidence or indication is found that surplus P relative to physiological requirement is beneficial. Future P feeding recommendations should continuously be based on the factorial method. The quantitatively most important improvement will be the increase and differentiation of the TAC value (true availability coefficient), which can be raised from 0.55 to 0.65 and 0.70 for the most common feeds. However, there is still no basis for a specific TAC for an individual feedstuff. When applying the recommended P allocation, it will be possible to increase the utilization of P in, e.g. high producing dairy cows, to 35–40\%.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to explore the trade-offs between economic performance (farm net income, FNI) and environmental outcomes (whole-farm P and N balances) of dairy farms in Wisconsin (WI; United States) and Québec (QC; Canada). An Excel-based linear program model (N-CyCLES; nutrient cycling: crops, livestock, environment, and soil) was developed to optimize feeding, cropping, and manure management as a single unit of management. In addition to FNI, P and N balances model outputs included (1) the mix of up to 9 home-grown and 17 purchased feeds for up to 5 animal groups, (2) the mix of up to 5 crop rotations in up to 5 land units and c) the mix of up to 7 fertilizers (solid and liquid manure and 5 commercial fertilizers) to allocate in each land unit. The model was parameterized with NRC nutritional guidelines and regional nutrient management planning rules. Simulations were conducted on a typical WI farm of 107 cows and 151 ha of cropland and, a Southern QC farm of 87 cows and 142 ha of cropland and all results were expressed per kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). In absence of constraints on P and N balances, maximum FNI was 0.12 and 0.11 \$/kg of FPCM for WI and QC, respectively, with P and N balances of 1.05 and 14.29 g/kg of FPCM in WI but 0.60 and 15.70 g/kg of FPCM in QC. The achievable reduction (balance at maximum FNI minus balance when the simulation objective was to minimize P or N balance) was 0.31 and 0.54 g of P/kg of FPCM (29 and 89\% reduction), but 2.37 and 3.31 g of N/kg of FPCM (17 and 24\% reduction) in WI and QC, respectively. Among other factors, differences in animal unit per hectare and reliance on biological N fixation may have contributed to lower achievable reductions of whole-farm balances in WI compared with QC. Subsequent simulations to maximize FNI under increasing constraints on nutrient balances revealed that it was possible to reduce P balance, N balance, and both together by up to 33\% without a substantial effect on FNI. Partial reduction in P balance reduced N balance (synergetic effect) in WI, but increased N balance (antagonistic effect) in QC. In contrast, reducing N balance increased P balance in both regions, albeit in different magnitudes. The regional comparison highlighted the importance of site-specific conditions on modeling outcomes. This study demonstrated that even when recommended guidelines are followed for herd nutrition and crop fertilization, the optimization of herd feeding, cropping, and manure spreading as a single unit of management may help identify management options that preserve FNI, while substantially reducing whole-farm nutrient balance.},

In humans and cows, where it has been studied, changes in milk calcium appear to be regulated by the amount of citrate and casein in milk rather than changes in [Ca2+]. Most or all of the calcium in milk is likely derived through exocytosis of secretory vesicles derived from the Golgi compartment where a calcium ATPase mediates transport from the cytoplasm. The identity of the transporters is not yet certain but gene expression for the plasma membrane calcium ATPase, PMCA2bw, and the secretory pathway calcium ATPase, SPCA, is highly upregulated during lactation. Currently nothing appears to be known about the mechanisms that mediate transport of calcium across the basolateral membrane of the alveolar cell.},

	abstract = {During pregnancy and lactation, female physiology adapts to meet the added nutritional demands of fetuses and neonates. An average full-term fetus contains ∼30 g calcium, 20 g phosphorus, and 0.8 g magnesium. About 80\% of mineral is accreted during the third trimester; calcium transfers at 300-350 mg/day during the final 6 wk. The neonate requires 200 mg calcium daily from milk during the first 6 mo, and 120 mg calcium from milk during the second 6 mo (additional calcium comes from solid foods). Calcium transfers can be more than double and triple these values, respectively, in women who nurse twins and triplets. About 25\% of dietary calcium is normally absorbed in healthy adults. Average maternal calcium intakes in American and Canadian women are insufficient to meet the fetal and neonatal calcium requirements if normal efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption is relied upon. However, several adaptations are invoked to meet the fetal and neonatal demands for mineral without requiring increased intakes by the mother. During pregnancy the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption doubles, whereas during lactation the maternal skeleton is resorbed to provide calcium for milk. This review addresses our current knowledge regarding maternal adaptations in mineral and skeletal homeostasis that occur during pregnancy, lactation, and post-weaning recovery. Also considered are the impacts that these adaptations have on biochemical and hormonal parameters of mineral homeostasis, the consequences for long-term skeletal health, and the presentation and management of disorders of mineral and bone metabolism.},

In this review, we focus on the role of PTHrP in the normal mammary gland and its contributions to breast pathogenesis. During embryonic mammary development, PTHrP drives mammary mesenchyme specification, which is responsible for maintaining mammary cell fate, promoting the outgrowth of ducts, and directing the formation of the nipple. During lactation, PTHrP mobilizes maternal calcium to ensure a supply of calcium into milk and may play a role in regulating neonatal bone and mineral metabolism. PTHrP is expressed in primary breast cancer and breast cancer metastases, and contributes to the formation of osteolytic bone lesions as well as the growth and progression of primary tumors.},

	abstract = {A dynamic, mechanistic, compartmental model of phosphorus (P) digestion and metabolism was constructed in the Advanced Continuous Simulation Language using conservation of mass principles and mass action kinetics. Phosphorus was assumed to exist in 3 forms: inorganic (Pi), phytic acid (Pp), and organic (excluding phytic acid; Po). All 3 forms were assumed to be present in the digestive tract with absorption of Pi into blood. Inputs to the model were total P intake; Pp, Po, and Pi as proportions of total P; milk yield; rate of salivation (fixed at 239L/d); and rate of liquid passage from the rumen (fixed at 198L/d). The model was fitted to 2 experiments from the literature. Derived parameters were well defined by the data. With a mean observed P intake of 75g/d, total tract P digestibility was 38\%. Phytic acid P digestibility in the rumen was 74\%, with no additional Pp digestion in the lower tract. Inorganic P and Po digestibility in the lower tract were 48 and 89\%, respectively. Flows of Po and Pi from the rumen were 2.4 and 3.0 times greater than intake, respectively. The increase in Po was apparently due to microbial growth. The increase in Pi arose primarily from secretion of Pi into the rumen via salivation where 65\% of absorbed P was recycled to the rumen. Milk synthesis used 30\% of absorbed Pi, and 1\% was excreted in urine. This research suggested that the primary regulation points for maintaining blood P were bone deposition and resorption and absorption from the intestine. However, because bone P balance was related to both dietary P intake and ruminal phytase activity, it is critical to achieve a better understanding of phytate digestibility across several feeds if dietary P is to be reduced below current requirements.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present evidence that cows fed highly cationic diets are less responsive to parathyroid hormone than those fed a highly anionic diet. Fortyseven Jersey cows (55 mo of age) were fed an alfalfa haylage-based diet supplemented with either anions (Cl-) or cations Na+). Cows fed the high cationic diet suffered significantly more cases of milk fever (6 out of 23) than those fed the high anionic diet (1 out of 24). Concentrations of Ca at parturition and the first 2 d of lactation were significantly higher in cows fed the anionic diet. Secretion of parathyroid hormone in response to developing hypocalcemia was similar in cows fed either diet. Plasma hydroxyproline concentration (an index of bone Ca resorption activity) was greater in cows fed the anionic diet, suggesting better utilization of bone Ca. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration was correlated inversely with plasma Ca and related directly to plasma parathyroid hormone in both groups of cows. However, the magnitude of the response (the amount of 1.25- dihydroxyvitamin D produced per unit increase in parathyroid hormone) was reduced greatly in cows fed the high cation diet. Because parathyroid hormone regulates both bone Ca resorption and renal 1,254ihydroxyvitamin D production, these data suggest that prepartal diets high in cations decrease the ability of bone and renal tissues to respond to parathyroid hormone. Addition of anions to prepartal diets can reduce the excess cation balance of diets, increasing tissue response to parathyroid hormone and enabling the cow to better adapt to the Ca demands of lactation.},

This 2-yr study examined content of Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, and Zn in milk of 54 Iberian red deer hinds through 18 wk of lactation. Mean mineral composition of fresh milk was ash = 1.168 ± 0.007\%, Ca = 2,330 ± 20 mg/kg, P = 640 ± 10 mg/kg, K = 1,100 ± 10 mg/kg, Na = 385 ± 3 mg/kg, Mg = 138 ± 1 mg/kg, Zn = 12.5 ± 0.2 mg/kg, and Fe = 0.65 ± 0.03 mg/kg. All minerals except Mg varied by week of lactation, but variation was usually \&lt;10\% except for Fe (83\% variation) and Zn (30\% variation); both of those minerals increased as lactation proceeded. Increased concentrations of Fe and Zn in later lactation compensated for the reduction in milk production in mid and late lactation such that daily production was less variable for Fe (55\% variation) or Zn (79\% variation) than for other minerals (118 to 135\% variation). Potassium content of milk decreased across time, but that effect occurred primarily during the last few weeks of lactation. Calving later vs. early in the calving season had variable effects on concentrations of different minerals: P, Mg, and K concentrations were not affected; Ca, Mg, and Na were all lower in milk from later calving hinds; and both Fe and Zn had higher concentrations in milk from hinds that calved later in the season. Lactating hinds seem to maintain a more stable daily yield of the microminerals Fe and Zn in milk compared with more variable concentrations of macrominerals as lactation progresses. Because of the essential role of Fe and Zn in immune function, a more stable supply of those minerals might be important to the health of growing red deer calves.},

There is now evidence implicating the essential involvement of vitamin D metabolites in a host of cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, immunology, cell differentiation, and regulation of gene transcription. Further, there is evidence that the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], may generate biological responses via both regulation of gene transcription as well as via nongenomic pathways, some of which involve opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In addition, there are many examples of pathological disruption of the normal state in which a drug form of a vitamin D metabolite is proposed to be a (potentially) useful form of treatment, e.g. renal osteodystrophy, psoriasis, leukemia, breast cancer, and osteoporosis.   B. From vitamin to steroid hormone The importance of the molecule vitamin D in the biological systems of higher animals has been recognized since its discovery by Mellanby in 1920 (1). It was in the interval of 1920–1930 that vitamin D officially became classified as a “vitamin” that was essential for the normal development of the skeleton and maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis. The chemical structure of vitamin D was not determined until 1932 (2), and it was only then that it was apparent that this important nutritional substance was in reality a steroid, more specifically, a secosteroid, indicating that one of the rings of the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring structure (the 9–10 carbon-carbon bond of ring B) was broken (see Section II).},

Sixteen Friesian cows from the University dairy herd were used to collect 9 samples during the lactation period and 5 samples during the dry period. The data were analysed using a split-plot design analysis of variance. There were no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) differences in cortical bone phosphorus concentrations in rib bone during the lactation period, but calcium concentrations in cortical bone were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher at parturition and during the first 30 days of lactation compared to the next 30 days and between 90 and 120 days. Results reported here indicate that the cow resorbs cortical bone during the middle of the lactation period and not during the periparturient period as previously thought. Magnesium concentrations were also significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher at the beginning of lactation compared to some of the other sampling times, but cortical bone was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) thinner at the bt binning of lactation compared to several of the other sampling times. There were no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) differences in cortical bone Ca or Mg concentrations during the gestation period. Cortical bone P concentrations significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased during the first 180 days, but significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased at 181-230 days and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) decreased again at 231 days to term. Cortical bone thickness decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) from the beginning of gestation to term. There were no significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05) differences in cortical bone thickness or Ca or Mg concentrations in cortical bone during the dry period, but cortical bone concentrations were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) greater at the end of the dry period compared to the first 30 days of the period. In general, cortical bone Ca and Mg values decreased as milk production increased up to 20 kg/day and cortical bone P values and bone thickness increased.

Ash content was higher in the metacarpal than in the caudal vertebrae, as were concentrations of Mg ( expressed as a proportion of bone ash). No effects of stage of lactation were observed on bone mineral in the caudal vertebrae, but in the metacarpal, P content ( proportion of total mineral) was highest in second lactation cows. Total bone mineral content ( ash) was not affected by parity in the metacarpal or caudal vertebra, but Ca and P content of the metacarpal increased with parity. Noninvasive imaging techniques are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in mineral content or composition of mature cows, and only modest changes in bone mineral were observed with stage of lactation and parity.},

	shorttitle = {Melatonin effects on bone},
	abstract = {Bone formation proceeds through a remodeling process that runs continuously, involving the resorption of old bone by osteoclasts, and the subsequent formation of new bone by osteoblasts. This is controlled by growth factors and cytokines produced in bone marrow microenvironment and by the action of systemic hormones, like parathyroid hormone, estradiol or growth hormone (GH). One candidate for hormonal modulation of osteoblast and osteoclast formation is melatonin. Because circulating melatonin declines with age, its possible involvement in post-menopausal and senescence osteoporosis is considered. This review article discusses early studies on melatonin-bone relationships and recent data that suggest a direct effect of melatonin on bone. Melatonin could act as an autacoid in bone cells as it is present in high quantities in bone marrow, where precursors of bone cells are located. Melatonin dose-dependently augmented proteins that are incorporated into the bone matrix, like procollagen type I c-peptide. Osteoprotegerin, an osteoblastic protein that inhibits the differentiation of osteoclasts is also augmented by melatonin in vitro. Another possible target cell for melatonin is the osteoclast, which degrades bone partly by generating free radicals. Melatonin through its free radical scavenger and antioxidant properties may impair osteoclast activity and bone resorption. At least in one study melatonin was both inhibitory to osteoclastic and osteoblastic cells. Therefore, the documented bone-protecting effect of melatonin in ovariectomized rats can depend in part on the free radical scavenging properties of melatonin. Additionally, melatonin may impair development of osteopenia associated with senescence by improving non-rapid eye movement sleep and restoring GH secretion. Whether melatonin can be used as a novel mode of therapy for augmenting bone mass in diseases deserves to be studied.},

More dystocia was experienced on farms where the stated policy was to administer extra vitamin D to dry cows, where dry cows were housed with the milking cows, or where calving occurred in maternity pens rather than stanchions. There was an increased likelihood of milk fever and left displaced abomasum on farms on which the stated policy was to lead feed. Farms where dairy farmers treated cases of retained placenta had more retained placenta than farms on which the treatment was done by the veterinarian.

The phylogenetically ancient signaling molecule serotonin is found in all species that possess nervous systems and orchestrates diverse behavioral and physiological processes in the service of energy balance. In some instances, the manner in which serotonin signaling influences these processes appears comparable among invertebrate and vertebrate species. Within mammalian species, central nervous system serotonergic signaling influences both behavioral and physiological determinants of energy balance. Within the gastrointestinal tract, serotonin mediates diverse sensory, motor, and secretory functions. Further examinations of serotonergic influences on peripheral organ systems are likely to uncover novel functions consistent with an apparently pervasive association between serotonergic signaling and physiological substrates of energy balance.},

	abstract = {Our study objectives were to evaluate the association of prepartum plasma Mg concentrations with subclinical hypocalcemia (SCH) classification at parturition and to evaluate the association of other cow-level risk factors with SCH classification at calving or at 2 d in milk (DIM). A total of 301 animals from 2 dairy herds located in New York were enrolled in a cohort study. Blood samples were collected at approximately 1 wk before the expected calving date, within 4 h of calving, and at 2 DIM. Prepartum samples had plasma macromineral concentrations (Ca, K, Mg, P), albumin, and β-hydroxybutyrate analyzed. Samples collected at calving were analyzed for Ca only, and samples from 2 DIM had macromineral and albumin concentrations determined. Postpartum SCH was defined as Ca concentrations ≤2.1 mmol/L. The prevalence of SCH at calving was 2, 40, and 66\% for first, second, and third or greater parities, respectively. Only 4\% of cows could be classified with prepartum subclinical hypomagnesemia (Mg concentrations \&lt;0.8 mmol/L), which did not provide enough power to appropriately determine the association of plasma Mg with postpartum Ca concentrations and its effect on SCH classification. Multiparous cows with Ca concentrations ≤2.4 mmol/L in the prepartum period and third or greater parity cows had a higher risk of being categorized as SCH at calving [relative risk (RR) = 1.4 and 1.7, respectively]. The risk of SCH at 2 DIM was associated with the interaction of Ca status at calving and lameness score. Nonlame cows with Ca concentrations ≤2.1 mmol/L (RR = 3.2) and normocalcemic lame cows at parturition (RR = 3.4) were more likely to be SCH at 2 DIM compared with nonlame normocalcemic cows. In conclusion, we identified a prepartum Ca cut-point for identification of cows that are more likely to be classified as SCH at calving. Different risk factors were associated with SCH depending on the timing of diagnosis relative to parturition.},

	abstract = {An equilibrium thermodynamic model of the interaction of calcium, phosphate and casein in milk is described in which the micellar calcium phosphate is assumed to be in the form of calcium phosphate nanoclusters. A generalized empirical formula for the nanocluster is used to define the molar ratios of small ions (Ca, Mg, Pi and citrate) to a casein phosphorylated sequence (phosphate centre, PC). From this model, a method of calculating the partition of milk salts into diffusible and non-diffusible fractions is obtained. No arbitrary assumptions are made, no fitting of adjustable parameters is done and the PCs in the caseins are defined by inspection of their primary structures. In addition to the salt partition, the mole fractions of the individual caseins not complexed to the calcium phosphate through one or more of their PCs are computed and a generic stability rule for milks is derived. The use of the model is illustrated by calculations of the partition of salts in a standard milk and by comparison with experimental data on the partition of salts in the milk of individual cows. The generic stability rule is applied to the individual milks to determine whether the micellar calcium phosphate is thermodynamically stable. According to the calculations, compositions that might lead to pathological calcification in the lumen of the mammary gland were seldom found in primiparous healthy cows in early or mid lactation but occurred more often in multiparous animals, in late lactation and during mastitic infection.},

	abstract = {The period, known to UK farmers and processors as the "spring flush", when the cows' diet changes from dry feed to spring pasture, has long been established as a time of change in milk properties and processing characteristics. Although it is believed to be a time when problems in processing are most likely to occur (e.g. milk that does not form clots or forms weak gels during cheesemaking), there is little evidence in the literature of detailed changes in milk composition and their impact on product manufacture. In this study, a range of physicochemical properties were analysed in milk collected from five commercial dairy herds before, during and after the spring flush period of 2006. In particular, total and ionic calcium contents of milk were studied in relation to other parameters including rennet clotting, acid gel properties, heat coagulation, alcohol stability, micelle size and zeta potential. Total divalent cations were significantly reduced from 35.4 to 33.4 mmol.L(-1) during the study, while ionic calcium was reduced from 1.48 to 1.40 mmol.L(-1) over the same period. Many parameters varied significantly between the sample dates. However, there was no evidence to suggest that any of the milk samples would have been unsuitable for processing - e.g. there were no samples that did not form clots with chymosin within a reasonable time or formed especially weak rennet or acid gels. A number of statistically significant correlations were found within the data, including ionic calcium concentration and pH; rennet clotting time (RCT) and micelle diameter; and RCT and ethanol stability. Overall, while there were clear variations in milk composition and properties over this period, there was no evidence to support the view that serious processing problems are likely during the change from dry feed to spring pasture.},

	abstract = {Sodium is the main cation of the extracellular fluid (ECF) (55\% of the total Na+ is in the ECF); the rest is located mainly in bone (40\%). Plasma Na+ concentration is 135–145 mEq./L; intracellular Na+ only reaches 10 mEq./L. Na+ contributes to half of the osmolarity of ECF and drives fluid movement between different body compartments. The major route for Na+ excretion is the kidney. Aldosterone is the main regulator of Na+ excretion in the kidney. Atrial natriuretic peptides also contribute to Na+ homeostasis. Potassium is the main cation of the intracellular space (90\% of the total K+ is in the ICF), with a concentration of ∼150 mEq./L. In plasma, K+ concentration is 4–5.5 mEq./L. K+ is eliminated in the urine in an aldosterone-regulated manner. Chloride is the main anion of the ECF, corresponding to 88\% of the total body Cl−. Plasma Cl− concentration is 102 mEq./L. Cl− is Na+ main attending anion; its amounts follow those of Na+. Cl− contributes importantly to plasma osmolarity. Its regulation is dependent on that of Na+. Calcium is abundant in bone. Plasma Ca2+ concentration is ∼5 mEq./L, 50\% of which exists as free Ca2+ and the rest is bound to proteins or forms nonionizable compounds. It is regulated by parathyroid hormone and calcitriol. Phosphorus is mainly located in bone (over 80\% of the total P) forming part of bone hydroxyapatite. In the ECF, phosphorus exists partly as phosphate anions ( HP O 4 2 − / H 2 P O 4 − ) ; the plasma concentration is 2.5–4.8 mEq./L. Calcitriol and parathyroid hormone are regulators of body phosphorus levels. Magnesium is an essential cation, involved in many enzymatic reactions. Its plasma concentration is 1.25–2.5 mEq./L. Iron is mainly bound to proteins in the body, including hemoglobin, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transferrin. Fe is continuously recycled in the body, particularly during the lysis and production of erythrocytes. Fe is eliminated mainly by the intestine. An overload of Fe results in formation of hemosiderin granules and hemosiderosis. Lack of Fe in the diet produces hypochromic microcytic anemia. Zinc is a constituent of many enzymes. Copper forms part of enzymes, such as cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase, monoamine oxidase, tyrosinase, and ceruloplasmin. Iodine is almost exclusively required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Manganese is required as a cofactor of some enzymes. Molybdenum is an important component of several metalloenzymes. Selenium is associated with two amino acids, selenomethionine and selenocysteine, which form part of different proteins, such as glutathione peroxidase, iodotyrosine deiodinases, thioredoxin reductase, and synthetase selenophosphate.},

	abstract = {Vitamins are organic compounds essential for normal health. They are not synthesized in the body and must be supplied with the diet. Some vitamins form coenzymes, and others function as hormones. Their deficiency produces specific pathological conditions (avitaminosis). Vitamins are divided into lipid soluble (A, D, E, and K) and water soluble (B and C). Vitamin A or retinol and its active derivatives, retinal and retinoic acid, are involved in processes, such as development of B and T helper lymphocytes, cell differentiation and apoptosis, and in molecular mechanisms of vision. Carotenes are vitamin A precursors. Vitamin D, calciferol, or antirachitic vitamin is a sterol derivative, which maintains body Ca2+ homeostasis and participates in phosphate balance. Vitamin E or tocopherol functions as an antioxidant. Vitamin K or antihemorrhagic vitamin is important for the synthesis of several blood coagulation factors. Vitamin B complex includes thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, panthotenic acid, piridoxin, biotin, folic acid, and cobalamin. All these vitamins form part of coenzymes and are involved in different metabolic pathways. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid is an important reducing agent, involved in redox processes, in collagen and catecholamine synthesis, and in the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, which facilitates reabsorption of iron in the intestine.},

	abstract = {Milk fever (MF) is a metabolic disease in dairy cows around parturition. The clinical lead sign is muscular paresis leading in severe cases to paralysis of the affected animal. Multiparturient animals of high performing dairy breeds are most likely to be affected and have a high probability of recurrence. An acute drop in blood calcium levels causes the disease when the demand for calcium at the onset of lactation exceeds the ability to replete blood calcium levels through mobilization from bone and intestinal uptake. With the understanding of the underlying mechanism, calcium supply management and vitamin D supplementation became prime candidates for MF prevention and therapy. Several strategies have been developed for MF prevention. Application of the active form of Vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, was found to prevent MF effectively. In order to prevent a delayed hypocalcemia, which was occasionally seen after stopping the treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, a new approach was chosen by applying Solanum glaucophyllum extract (SGE), which contains 1,25(OH)2D3-glycosides, as instant-release (irSGE) in combination with slow-release (srSGE) tablets.
In a first study, non-lactating cows were treated with a single bolus of either synthetic 1,25(OH)2D3, irSGE, or srSGE and the results were compared to a control group without treatment. Blood serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 (1,25D), calcium (Ca), phosphate (P) and magnesium (Mg) were followed for 11 days and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Calcium and phosphate excretion in urine were determined during 15 days. While serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 was back to pre-treatment level in the irSGE, srSGE and 1,25(OH)2D3 treated group within 3 days, calcium and phosphate levels remained elevated for up to 9 days. AUC of serum 1,25(OH)2D3 was 2.89 (1,25D), 3.13 (irSGE) and 4.21 (srSGE) times higher than control. Serum calcium levels were 1.07* (for 1.25D); 1.08* (for irSGE) and 1.12* (for srSGE) times higher than control. Serum phosphate levels were 1.20* (for 1,25D); 1.30* (for irSGE) and 1.41* (for srSGE) times higher than control, with * p \&lt; 0.05. In a second field study calving cows treated with one bolus containing ir- and sr- tablets of SGE were compared to an untreated control group and to a group treated with 4 boli of commercial calcium salts. As a result, calcium serum levels increased (+19\% compared to baseline) around calving after treatment with the single bolus of SGE. The single bolus of SGE lead also to an increase of serum phosphate (+31\% compared to baseline). These calcium and phosphate increases were statistically significant (p \&lt; 0.001) 0–24 hours after calving compared to the control group and to the group treated with calcium salts. The sample size of the study was too small to draw a conclusion on the effect on MF prevention.
In conclusion, application of a single bolus of a SGE extract lead to an increase of serum calcium and phosphate for up to 9 days and may thus have the potential to prevent a hypocalcemia and −phosphatemia, an important cause for clinical milk fever.},

Serum calcium and magnesium concentrations increased during the first 6 months of lactation. Serum 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D was increased at 6 months of lactation compared to values in nonpregnant nonlactating controls. During this same period, serum parathyroid hormone decreased slightly and serum calcitonin remained unchanged. Our data do not support the observation that lactation represents a state of physiological hyperparathyroidism. On the contrary, our results suggest that lactating women are able to adequately compensate for the losses of calcium and phosphorus during the early months of lactation, although increased serum 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations may be necessary to maintain calcium homeostasis with lactation beyond 6 months.},

	abstract = {Data from 137 published trials involving 2,545 calvings were analyzed using random effects normal logistic regression models to identify risk factors for clinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows. The aim of the study was to examine which form, if any, of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) equation provided the best estimate of milk fever risk and to clarify roles of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations of prepartum diets in the pathogenesis of milk fever. Two statistically equivalent and biologically plausible models were developed that predict incidence of milk fever. These models were validated using data from 37 trials excluded from the original data used to generate the models; missing variables were replaced with mean values from the analyzed data. The preferred models differed slightly; Model 1 included prepartum DCAD, and Model 2 included prepartum dietary concentrations of potassium and sulfur alone, but not sodium and chloride. Other factors, included in both models were prepartum dietary concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus; days exposed to the prepartum diet; and breed. Jersey cows were at 2.25 times higher risk of milk fever than Holstein cows in Model 1. The results support the DCAD theory of greater risk of milk fever with higher prepartum dietary DCAD (odds ratio = 1.015). The only DCAD equation supported in statistical analyses was (Na+ + K+) − (Cl− + S2−). This finding highlights the difference between developing equations to predict DCAD and those to predict milk fever. The results support a hypothesis of a quadratic role for Ca in the pathogenesis of milk fever (model 1, odds ratio = 0.131; Model 2, odds ratio = 0.115). Milk fever risk was highest with a prepartum dietary concentration of 1.35\% calcium. Increasing prepartum dietary magnesium concentrations had the largest effect on decreasing incidence of milk fever in both Model 1 (odds ratio = 0.006) and Model 2 (odds ratio = 0.001). Increasing dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum increased the risk of milk fever (Model 1, odds ratio = 6.376; Model 2, odds ratio = 9.872). The models presented provide the basis for the formulation of diets to reduce the risk of milk fever and strongly support the need to evaluate macro mineral nutrition apart from DCAD of the diet.},

	abstract = {The periparturient or transition period of 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after calving is characterised by a greatly increased risk of disease. Hypocalcaemia around calving is a risk factor for many of these diseases and is an indirect risk factor for increased culling. The incidence of clinical hypocalcaemia (milk fever) in the field generally ranges from 0–10\%, but may exceed 25\% of cows calving. In research trials conducted on milk fever the incidence has approached 80\% of cows calving.
Homeostasis of calcium (Ca) is regulated by calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. Age increases the risk of milk fever by approximately 9\% per lactation. Control of milk fever has revolved around stimulation of homeostatic mechanisms through feeding a pre-calving diet low in Ca. More recently, the role of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) in the prevention of Ca disorders has been examined, both by field research and meta-analysis. The most appropriate form of the DCAD equation has been contentious, but recent meta-analyses have shown that the equation (Na+ + K+) − (Cl− + S2−) is most effective for predicting milk fever risk. Decreased risk of milk fever is linear with DCAD, whereas the effect of DCAD on urinary pH is curvilinear. A pivotal role of providing dietary magnesium (Mg) before calving has been confirmed by meta-analysis, and a quadratic effect of Ca on milk fever risk was found with a peak occurring with dietary levels of 1.1–1.3\% of dry matter.
Risks of milk fever increase with increased dietary phosphorus (P) fed pre-calving and with increasing days of exposure to a pre-calving diet. Meta-analysis has revealed that the important roles of dietary Ca, Mg and P, as well as the duration of exposure to the pre-calving diet in milk fever control strategies are independent of DCAD. Studies on the effect of exposure to well designed pre-calving diets have shown that substantial improvements in production, reproduction and animal health can be made but further examination of the influence of the period of exposure to different diets is warranted.},

The results were statistically analyzed and compared between the two groups.

Three hundred seventy-five fresh Holstein cows were blocked based on parity (143 cows in first parity, 108 cows in second parity, and 124 cows in third or greater parity) and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental treatments immediately after calving. Treatments were control group without infusion (control; n = 190); 1 s.c. infusion of 250 mL of 40\% Ca borogluconate (1SC250; n = 72) at calving; 1 s.c. infusion of 500 mL of 40\% Ca borogluconate (1SC500; n = 63) at calving; 2 s.c. infusions of 250 mL of 40\% Ca borogluconate, one immediately after calving and the second 12 to 18 h after first infusion (2SC250; n = 50). Blood samples were collected immediately after parturition and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 d in milk (DIM) for Ca, P, and Mg determination. Milk production, milk composition, and somatic cell count were recorded monthly up to 90 DIM. The evaluation of BCS was performed at calving and at 38 DIM. A subset of 9 cows per treatment group was randomly chosen to measure serum concentration of glucose and BHB at 2, 4, and 7 DIM. Total serum Ca in 1SC250 (8.95 mg/dL), 1SC500 (9.27 mg/dL), and 2SC250 (9.07 mg/dL) was greater during the first week postpartum compared with control (8.45 mg/dL). Serum concentrations of P, Mg, BHB, glucose, and milk yield were not affected by treatments. The dry matter intake during the first 24 h after calving was higher for treatments 1SC250 (13.5 kg), 1SC500 (15.0 kg), and 2SC250 (15.6 kg) relative to control (12.5 kg). Milk somatic cell counts were lower for 1SC500 (90.5 cells/mL) and 2SC250 (82.2 cells/mL) than control (132.8 cells/mL). Risk ratio was \&gt;1 for development of metritis, and clinical and subclinical endometritis in control cows relative to 2SC250 cows, which indicates a higher risk of developing disease for control cows (2.03, 1.7, and 1.8 times, respectively). These results suggest that prophylactic s.c. infusions of Ca at calving can improve postpartum Ca status in Holstein cows and intake at 1 DIM. Given the reduction of metritis, clinical and subclinical endometritis, and subclinical hypocalcemia with treatment, the effect of s.c. Ca supplementation on immune status warrants further investigation.},

MFA proceeds in two steps: First it computes a PCA of each data table and ‘normalizes’ each data table by dividing all its elements by the first singular value obtained from its PCA. Second, all the normalized data tables are aggregated into a grand data table that is analyzed via a (non-normalized) PCA that gives a set of factor scores for the observations and loadings for the variables. In addition, MFA provides for each data table a set of partial factor scores for the observations that reflects the specific ‘view-point’ of this data table. Interestingly, the common factor scores could be obtained by replacing the original normalized data tables by the normalized factor scores obtained from the PCA of each of these tables. In this article, we present MFA, review recent extensions, and illustrate it with a detailed example. WIREs Comput Stat 2013, 5:149–179. doi: 10.1002/wics.1246},

The adaptation of the maternal calcium homeostatic mechanisms is the result of a complex interplay between calciotropic hormones and the tissues, intestine, bone, and kidney, responsible for providing the large amounts of calcium needed to support fetal skeletal growth and lactation. In this review, we will discuss general calcium homeostasis followed by a review of the specific adaptations required by the human, rat, and cow to meet fetal and lactational demands for calcium. Finally, we will review what is known about the regulation of calcium transfer from the plasma to the milk.},

Forty-eight cows in their first to third parity were allocated to eight groups of 6 animals each, based on stage of lactation and milk yield. Groups 1 ( control), 2 ( Ca), 3 ( P) and 4 ( Zn) received, respectively, no mineral supplement, 10 g Ca, 8 g P and 400 mg Zn. The rest of the groups received a combination of Ca/P, Ca/Zn, P/Zn or Ca/P/ Zn. Animals were drenched daily. Ovarian activity was determined by progesterone concentrations in milk. Prepartum body condition score ( BCS) measured using scale 1-5 was 2.5-3.5. Reproductive problems were observed in all groups except that supplemented with Ca. Cows supplemented with Ca, P, Ca/P, Ca/Zn and Ca/P/ Zn had significantly ( p {\textless} 0.05) shorter interval ( 30 days) from calving to resumption of oestrus as compared to control ( 69 days). Intervals from calving to conception and between calvings did not differ significantly between groups ( p {\textgreater} 0.05), but were shorter in Ca-supplemented cows. Furthermore, cows in groups 2 and 3 needed an average of 2 services per conception against 3 for cows in other groups. Hence, supplementation with Ca, P and Zn of deficient dairy cows appears to improve reproductive performance.},

The determinations of Pb, Cd and As contents were by graphite furnace AAS and Cu, Mg, Ca, Fe and Zn was by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that Pb, Cd, As and Cu presented in feedstuffs, but Pb, Cd and As were lowly detected in milk samples, and Cu was not detected in milk samples. The content of Mg in concentrates was lower than that in forages. However, the content of Mg in milk from concentrate feed was higher than that in forage feed. This suggested that the utilization of Mg in concentrate feed was higher than that in forage feed. The contents of Ca and Zn were opposite to Mg, and the utilization of Ca and Zn in forage feed was higher than that in concentrate feed. There was no obviously change law of Fe in different feedstuffs and milk samples. The relationship between the contents of trace metal elements in milk to feedstuffs would provide a theoretical basis for dairy farming.

Disease index variables were created to relate the timing of a disease to the measures of test day milk. Statistical models for each parity and disease included fixed effects of calving season, stage of lactation, and disease index. An autoregressive correlation structure was used to model the association among the repeated measurements.
The milk yield of cows contracting milk fever was affected for a period of 4 to 6 wk after calving; the loss ranged from 1.1 to 2.9 kg/d, depending on parity and the time elapsed after milk fever diagnosis. Despite the loss, cows with milk fever produced 1.1 to 1.7 kg more milk/d than did healthy cows. Milk yield started to decline 2 to 4 wk before the diagnosis of ketosis and continued to decline for a varying time period after it. The daily milk loss was greatest within the 2 wk after the diagnosis, varying from 3.0 to 5.3 kg/d, depending on parity. Cows in parity 4 or higher were most severely affected by ketosis; the average total loss per cow was 353.4 kg. Lameness also affected milk yield; milk loss of cows diagnosed with foot and leg disorders varied between 1.5 and 2.8 kg/d during the first 2 wk after the diagnosis.},

The data were weekly recordings from 4414 lactations collected in three Danish research herds. High milk yield was a risk factor for ketosis and enteritis. Heavier primiparous cows were more likely to contract mastitis. Milk yield was decreased for a disease-specific period for all study diseases except cystic ovaries and right displaced abomasum. Metabolic disorders had a detrimental effect on body weight. The highest weight loss (69kg) was associated with left displaced abomasum. The persistence of the weight loss differed considerably among study diseases. Almost all weight loss occurred up to and including the initial week after diagnosis, which emphasized the detrimental effect of the subclinical stage. However, weekly measured body weight seemed superior to weekly energy corrected test day milk yield for disease detection only for decreased rumen motility and left displaced abomasum.

	abstract = {Recently, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was identified as one of the major causes of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in several species. The hormone probably has an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of mammals and birds. Many endocrine, paracarine and autocrine functions are attributed to PTHrP. Parathormone shares the same receptor with PTHrP. This receptor was isolated in many tissues. PTHrP could be an important fetal growth factor. The influenced of PTHrP on calcium homeostasis is presently the object of active research. PTHrP stimulates calcium transfer through the placenta and maintains a concentration gradient between the dam's blood and the fetus. The hormone is produced in large quantities in milk. However, its exact and principal function in lactation has not yet been determined. Among other effects, PTHrP might stimulate the secretion of calcium, phosphate and magnesium in milk and might foster the development of the mammary gland. A role of PTHrP in the pathogenesis of postparturient paresis in dairy cows has been hypothesized. Results of recent trials demonstrate that despite an important role in calcium homeostasis, PTHrP is not pivotal in the development of milk fever.},

	abstract = {The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the influences of Ca and P contents in an anionic diet on the mineral metabolism in plasma, urine and bone in periparturient dairy cows. Fifteen multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows were divided into 3 dietary groups (5 cows/group) by dietary Ca and P contents and dietary cation-anion balance [(Na + K) - (Cl + S) mEq/kg DM]: diet I [low Ca (0.46\%), low P (0.24\%), cationic (+195.8 mEq/kg DM)]; diet 2 [low Ca (0.46\%), low P (0.24\%), anionic (-32.4 mEq/kg DM)]; and diet 3 [high Ca (0.93\%), high P (0.60\%), anionic (-41.0 mEq/kg DM)]. Cows were fed one of these 3 diets from approximately 4 weeks before the expected calving date to 5 days after calving. There was no outbreak of milk fever in any cows fed these 3 diets; however, plasma Ca levels at 1 and 2 days after calving tended to be higher in the cows fed diet 3 than those in the cows fed diets ! or 2. Fractional urinary excretion of Ca in the cows fed diet 2 or 3 was higher than that in the cows fed diet 1. Fractional urinary excretion and plasma level of Pi were higher during the periparturient period in the cows fed diet 3 than those in the cows fed diets I or 2. There were no significant differences in plasma parathyroid hormone levels among the 3 groups. In the spongy substance of ilium at 5 days after calving, the Ca and Mg contents, bone volume and trabecular thickness were the lowest, but not significant, in the cows fed diet 2. These data suggest that sufficient Ca and P contents in an anionic diet may be effective in maintaining plasma Ca and Pi levels of periparturient cows and further in preventing of potential bone damage brought about by increased urinary mineral excretion following the feeding of an anionic diet.},

	abstract = {Around parturition, many dairy cows experience varying degrees of hypocalcemia, which increases the incidence of several diseases in early lactation. In the current study, an established concept of feeding a diet negative in cation-anion difference (DCAD) was combined with oral supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25-OHD3) from d 270 of gestation until parturition. Fifty-six dairy cows were divided into 2 feeding groups (low DCAD and control). Fourteen animals of each group received a daily dosage of 3 mg of 25-OHD3. From the beginning of the treatment to d 10 after parturition, plasma samples for analysis of 25-OHD3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca2+, phosphate, the bone resorption marker CrossLaps, and osteocalcin were collected every other day, at calving, and at 6, 12, and 24 h after calving. Urine samples for determination of macrominerals and measures of acid-base status were collected on d 6 of treatment and on d 6 after calving. The induction of a compensated metabolic acidosis by the animals on the DCAD diet could be demonstrated by decreased urinary pH. A linear correlation between treatment duration and the plasma concentration of 25-OHD3 indicated effective absorption of 25-OHD3 in supplemented animals. The mean plasma concentrations of Ca2+ from d -4 prepartum to d 4 postpartum were significantly higher in animals treated with the combination of the low DCAD diet and 25-OHD3 supplementation (1.24 perpendicular to 0.02 mmol/mL) compared with the 3 other groups (low DCAD: 1.17 +/- 0.02 mmol/mL; control diet plus 25-OHD3: 1.16 +/- 0.02 mmol/mL; control diet: 1.18 +/- 0.02 mmol/mL). We postulate that the increased tissue responsiveness to parathyroid hormone induced by the low DCAD is crucial for the observed positive effects of the 25-OHD3 treatment.},

This calcium is distributed between the casein micelles in the colloidal and aqueous phases. Information on the properties of calcium activity in the aqueous phase is limited compared with that on the properties of bound or sequestrated calcium. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the changes in calcium activity in fresh milk using an ion-selective electrode and to assess the relationship between calcium activity and milk production in hot season. Milk samples collected from 10 cows at the National Agricultural Research Center for Kyushu Okinawa Region in June to October (Min-Max: 7.2-35.2 degrees C, 24.3-100\% RH) were analyzed on total calcium concentrations and calcium activity. We observed that the rectal temperature of the cows increased according to elevation of ambient temperature but that the pH of the collected milk (6.61+/-0.01 (Mean+/-SEM)) was not significantly influenced by rectal and ambient temperature. Total calcium concentrations and calcium activity in fresh milk decreased in July (Min-Max: 21.1-33.5 degrees C, 48.9-100.0\% RH) compared with the values after August (Min-Max: 18.1-35.0 degrees C, 26.5-96.2\% RH) (p{\textless}0.05); however, there was no significant correlation between the two parameters. The ratio of calcium activity to total calcium concentration decreased after August compared with the values in June and July (p{\textless}0.05). The calcium activity in fresh milk was positively correlated with milk yield (r = 0.45, p{\textless}0.01) and negatively correlated with milk lactose content (r = -0.53, p{\textless}0.01). These results suggest that the calcium activity in milk could be affected by ambient temperature and might be associated with milking production in hot season.},

Thus, thermally damaged milk (overheated, OH, milk; 3 cycles of sterilization at 116 degrees C, 16 min) was compared with UHT milk (150 degrees C, 6 s) in 2 types of assays: in vitro and in vivo (rats). In addition, the greater Maillard reaction rate associated with thermal treatment in OH milk was confirmed by determining specific (furosine) and unspecific markers (CieLab color). A negative effect on calcium solubility was observed after in vitro digestion of OH milk compared with UHT milk. Feeding rats the diet containing OH milk as the protein source led to significantly lower values of apparent calcium absorption and retention than those found among animals fed the UHT milk diet. Whereas reducing the absorption appears to result mainly from the decreased food intake, the negative effect on retention seems to be due to factors derived from milk thermal damage, such as the formation of Maillard reaction products. It was concluded that milk-processing conditions warrant special attention to prevent impaired dietary calcium utilization. This may be especially important in situations where milk and dairy products are the main dietary components, such as in early infancy.},

	abstract = {The need for vitamin D supplementation of dairy cattle has been known for the better part of the last century and is well appreciated by dairy producers and nutritionists. Whether current recommendations and practices for supplemental vitamin D are meeting the needs of dairy cattle, however, is not well known. The vitamin D status of animals is reliably indicated by the concentration of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] metabolite in serum or plasma, with a concentration of 30 ng/mL proposed as a lower threshold for sufficiency. The objective of this study was to determine the typical serum 25(OH)D concentrations of dairy cattle across various dairy operations. The serum 25(OH)D concentration of 702 samples collected from cows across various stages of lactation, housing systems, and locations in the United States was 68 ± 22 ng/mL (mean ± standard deviation), with the majority of samples between 40 and 100 ng/mL. Most of the 12 herds surveyed supplemented cows with 30,000 to 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/d, and average serum 25(OH)D of cows at 100 to 300 DIM in each of those herds was near or above 70 ng/mL regardless of season or housing. In contrast, average serum 25(OH)D of a herd supplementing with 20,000 IU/d was 42 ± 15 ng/mL, with 22\% below 30 ng/mL. Cows in early lactation (0 to 30 d in milk) also had lower serum 25(OH)D than did mid- to late-lactation cows (57 ± 17 vs. 71 ± 20 ng/mL, respectively). Serum 25(OH)D of yearling heifers receiving 11,000 to 12,000 IU of vitamin D3/d was near that of cows at 76 ± 15 ng/mL. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations of calves, on the other hand, was 15 ± 11 ng/mL at birth and remained near or below 15 ng/mL through 1 mo of age if they were fed pasteurized waste milk with little to no summer sun exposure. In contrast, serum 25(OH)D of calves fed milk replacer containing 6,600 and 11,000 IU of vitamin D2/kg of dry matter were 59 ± 8 and 98 ± 33 ng/mL, respectively, at 1 mo of age. Experimental data from calves similarly indicated that serum 25(OH)D achieved at approximately 1 mo of age would increase 6 to 7 ng/mL for every 1,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg of dry matter of milk replacer. In conclusion, vitamin D status of dairy cattle supplemented with vitamin D3 according to typical practices, about 1.5 to 2.5 times the National Research Council recommendation, is sufficient as defined by serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Newborn calves and calves fed milk without supplemental vitamin D3, however, are prone to deficiency.},

	abstract = {The background to the development of a novel concept for the prepartal activation of calcium absorption capacity as a means of preventing parturient hypocalcaemia and milk fever in grazing ruminants is described. It was hypothesised that this objective could be achieved by decreasing the bio-availability of calcium from pasture for a 3 week period. Soya bean oil was chosen as a supplement, from a number of potential binding agents, to form poorly digestible calcium soaps in the gastrointestinal tract. 28 mature twin-pregnant ewes in late pregnancy were used as assay animals to test the hypothesis, and they proved to be a sensitive experimental model for dairy cows. Following the treatment period, overnight starvation was used to challenge calcium homeostasis. Calcium absorption capacity was assessed indirectly by measuring strontium concentrations in plasma following oral dosing with strontium chloride. Strong support for the hypothesis was obtained as the 14 Treated ewes were protected from severe fasting-induced hypocalcaemia (P=0.002), and this was associated with a greatly increased capacity of the ewes to absorb calcium. The feeding strategy developed in this experiment led to the production of a Calcigard(R) concentrate supplement which was subsequently shown to protect cows from hypocalcaemia and milk fever, and stimulate production.},

	abstract = {The hypocalcemia associated with the clinical disease known as milk fever is due to a failure of the calcium homeostatic mechanisms in the cow to restore normal blood calcium concentration in a timely manner at the onset of lactation. The defect in calcium homeostasis appears to reside in the sensitivity of bone and kidney tissues to parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulation. Evidence suggests the acid-base status of the cow dictates the sensitivity of the tissues to PTH stimulation, and that metabolic alkalosis is responsible for blunting tissue PTH responsiveness. Hypomagnesemia can also reduce tissue PTH responsiveness but hypomagnesemia can be corrected in most rations. Excessive dietary potassium is very common and is the most important factor causing metabolic alkalosis in dairy cows. Formulation of rations to reduce metabolic alkalosis and / or induce a compensated metabolic acidosis in the pre-partal cow has proved a useful strategy for prevention of milk fever. The concept of dietary cation-anion difference manipulation and the physiologic effects this can have in the cow are presented, with special emphasis on the Strong Ion Difference theory of acid-base physiology.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine effect of prophylactic treatment of dairy cattle with a calcium chloride gel on serum calcium concentration in the immediate postpartum period and incidence of parturient paresis, retained fetal membranes, and displacement of the abomasum.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
ANIMALS: 204 Holstein cows.
PROCEDURE: Cows were paired according to parity, whether they had previously had parturient paresis, and expected calving date. Cows in the treatment group received doses of calcium chloride gel 12 hours before expected calving, at calving, and 12 and 24 hours after calving. Cows in the control group did not receive calcium chloride gel.
RESULTS: Compared with concentration in the control cows, mean serum calcium concentration in cows treated with calcium chloride gel was significantly increased on postcalving days 1 and 2. The increase was significant only in cows that were third parity or greater. Calcium chloride gel treatment also resulted in significantly reduced incidence of parturient paresis, parturient hypocalcemia, and displaced abomasum. The incidence of parturient paresis was lower in cows that received the precalving dose of calcium chloride gel (0/39) than in cows that did not receive the precalving dose (5/63).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that periparturient prophylactic treatment of dairy cattle with an oral calcium chloride gel may be beneficial and that treatment would be most effective for cows of third parity or greater. Administration of a precalving dose of calcium chloride gel is necessary to reduce the incidence of parturient paresis, but postcalving treatment alone has other beneficial effects.},

The representation of the within-herd dynamics was based on the existing SimHerd II model. Because of the relationships between MF and other diseases, the new model (called “SimHerd III”) includes diseases common in a dairy herd.

The cow level risk factors modelled were: base risk in the herd, parity, milk-yield potential, lactational disease recurrence, disease interrelationships, body condition and season. The diseases include clinical cases of MF, dystocia, downer-cow syndrome, retained placenta, metritis, displaced abomasum, ketosis and mastitis. The effects of diseases were represented by daily milk yield, daily body weight, daily feed intake, risk of stillbirth, conception probability, decision on culling, death and immediate removal. Simulated technical results showed that the herd effects of reduced risk of MF differed according to the reproductive efficiency in the herd. These interactions between reproduction efficiency and the effect of reduced base risk of MF were related to differences in how the simulated herds reacted to the reduction in replacements caused by MF.

In the sensitivity analysis, eight potential key parameters were changed to their lowest and highest expected values retrieved from the literature. When measuring the sensitivity on milk production in the herd (as the economically most important technical effect), the model seemed most sensitive to the uncertainty of effect of MF on death risk and MF-recurrence risk.},

During the second experimental period (P2), half of the cows were fed for ad libitum intake and subjected to heat-stress conditions [WFHS, n = 6; cyclical temperature 31.1 to 38.9°C, 20\% humidity: minimum temperature humidity index (THI) = 73, maximum THI = 80.5], and half of the cows were pair-fed to match the intake of WFHS cows in thermal neutral conditions (TNPF, n = 6) for 9 d. Rectal temperature and respiration rate were measured thrice daily at 0430, 1200, and 1630 h. To evaluate muscle and liver insulin responsiveness, biopsies were obtained immediately before and after an insulin tolerance test on the last day of each period. Insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), AKT/protein kinase B (AKT), and phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) were measured by Western blot analyses for both tissues. During P2, WFHS increased rectal temperature and respiration rate by 1.48°C and 2.4-fold, respectively. Heat stress reduced dry matter intake by 8 kg/d and, by design, TNPF cows had similar intake reductions. Milk yield was decreased similarly (30\%) in WFHS and TNPF cows, and both groups entered into a similar (−4.5 Mcal/d) calculated negative energy balance during P2. Insulin infusion caused a less rapid glucose disposal in P2 compared with P1, but glucose clearance did not differ between environments in P2. In liver, insulin increased p-AKT protein content in each period. Phosphorylation ratio of AKT increased 120\% in each period after insulin infusion. In skeletal muscle, protein abundance of the IR, IRS, and AKT remained stable between periods and environment. Insulin increased skeletal muscle p-AKT in each period, but the phosphorylation ratio (abundance of phosphorylated protein:abundance of total protein) of AKT was decreased in P2 for TNPF animals, but not during WFHS. These results indicate that mild systemic insulin resistance during HS may be related to reduced nutrient intake but skeletal muscle and liver insulin signaling remains unchanged.},

	abstract = {The influence of a deficient magnesium supply during the dry period on the ability of dairy cows to mobilise calcium at parturition was investigated. The daily rations pre-partum consisted of 6 kg grass hay, and 4 kg concentrates containing either 1.58 per cent magnesium (HMg) or 0.22 per cent magnesium (LMg). Nine cows of parity one to six received the LMg diet and 10 cows of parity one to seven the HMg diet. Both rations provided 1.40 times maintenance on an energy basis and contained 4 per cent potassium in the dry matter. Throughout the dry period the mean concentration of magnesium in the plasma of the LMg group was significantly lower than in the HMg group and at parturition the mean plasma concentrations were 0.65 mmol litre-1 and 1.16 mmol litre-1, respectively. After parturition two cows in the LMg group showed clinical signs of hypocalcaemia but none of the HMg group did so. Cows of the LMg group had a lower mean rate of calcium mobilisation (0.27 mmol min-1) than those of the HMg group (0.34 mmol min-1) but the difference could not be explained by differences in bone turnover as reflected by urinary hydroxyproline excretion. Such a reduced rate of calcium mobilisation may be a contributory factor in the high incidence of milk fever in some herds fed inadequate magnesium in the dry period.},

	abstract = {Calcium, Mg, P, and K are of great importance for the health and productivity of dairy cows after calving. So far genetic studies have focused on clinical hypocalcemia, leaving the genetic parameters of these macroelements unstudied. Our objective was to estimate the genetic parameters of Ca, Mg, P, and K serum concentrations and their changes during the first 8 d after calving. The study was conducted in 9 herds located in northern Greece, with 1,021 Holstein cows enrolled from November 2010 until November 2012. No herd used any kind of preventive measures for hypocalcemia. Pedigree information for all cows was available. A total of 35 cows were diagnosed and treated for periparturient paresis and, therefore, excluded from the study. The remaining 986 cows were included in genetic analysis. The distribution of cows across parities was 459 (parity 1), 234 (parity 2), 158 (parity 3), and 135 (parity ≥4). A sample of blood was taken from each cow on d 1, 2, 4, and 8 after calving and serum concentrations of Ca, P, Mg, and K were measured in each sample. A final data set of 15,390 biochemical records was created consisting of 3,903 Ca, 3,902 P, 3,903 Mg, and 3,682 K measurements. Moreover, changes of these concentrations between d 1 and 4 as well as 1 and 8 after calving were calculated and treated as different traits. Random regression models were used to analyze the data. Results showed that daily heritabilities of Ca, P, and Mg concentrations traits were moderate to high (0.20–0.43), whereas those of K were low to moderate (0.12–0.23). Regarding concentration changes, only Mg change between d 1 and 8 after calving had a significant heritability of 0.18. Genetic correlations between Ca, P, Mg, and K concentrations and their concentration changes from d 1 to 4 and 1 to 8 after calving were not significantly different from zero. Most phenotypic correlations among Ca, P, Mg, and K concentrations were positive and low (0.09–0.16), whereas the correlation between P and Mg was negative and low (−0.16). Phenotypic correlations among macromineral concentrations on d 1 and their changes from d 1 to 4 and 1 to 8 after calving varied for each macromineral. This study revealed that genetic selection for normal Ca, P, Mg, and K concentrations in the first week of lactation is possible and could facilitate the management of their deficiencies during the early stages of lactation.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the potential importance of calcitonin (CALC) in the onset of subclinical hypocalcemia (experiment 1) and in the physiological mechanisms underlying the prevention of bovine hypocalcemia under metabolic acidosis (experiments 2 and 3). In experiment 1, 15 Holstein cows naturally incurring subclinical hypocalcemia during the first 5 d postpartum were classified as low subclinical hypocalcemia (LSH) when blood Ca concentrations were between 7.5 and 8.5 mg/dL, or as high subclinical hypocalcemia (HSH) when blood Ca concentrations were between 6.0 and 7.6 mg/dL. Blood samples were taken daily from d −5 to 5 relative to parturition to determine concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), CALC, and 1,25(OH)2D3. In experiment 2, 24 Holstein bulls (497 ± 69 kg of body weight and 342 ± 10.5 d of age) were assigned to 2 treatments (metabolic acidosis or control). Metabolic acidosis was induced by an oral administration of ammonium chloride (2.5 mEq/d) during 10 d, and animals were slaughtered thereafter. Blood samples were collected before slaughter to determine CALC, PTH, 1,25(OH)2D3, and samples of urine, kidney, parathyroid, and thyroid glands were obtained immediately after slaughter to determine expression of several genes in these tissues. Last, in experiment 3, we tested the activity of CALC under metabolic acidosis in vitro using breast cancer cell (T47D) cultures. Although PTH tended to be greater in HSH than in LSH, the levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 were lower in HSH cows (experiment 1). Blood CALC concentration was not affected by the severity of subclinical hypocalcemia, but it was influenced by days from calving (experiment 1). The expression of PTH receptor (PTHR) in the kidney was increased under metabolic acidosis (experiment 2). Furthermore, the activity of CALC was impaired under acidic blood pH (experiment 3). In conclusion, the CALC rise in HSH cows after calving impaired the recovery of blood Ca concentrations because the PTHR response was not sufficient to activate 1,25(OH)2D3 and compensate for the CALC effect. Metabolic acidosis prevents hypocalcemia because the expression of PTHR is upregulated in the kidney, resulting in an increased PTH activity and a subsequent increase in 1,25(OH)2D3 serum concentrations. Moreover, an impairment of CALC activity at low pH enhances the hypercalcemic role of PTH.},

	abstract = {Calcium metabolism in pregnancy is a complex process involving calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin (CT). Calcium absorption is enhanced in pregnancy, and increased storage in the maternal skeleton probably occurs as well. Adequate amounts are provided by the current Recommended Dietary Allowance of 1,200 mg. daily which can be met readily by natural foods, specifically milk. If supplemental calcium is given, a nonphosphate salt is probably advisable, since some evidence suggests that excessive phosphate intake may be related to leg cramps in pregnancy. Vitamin D is necessary for optimal calcium utilization in pregnancy, although the possibility of fetal toxicity with overdosage has been suggested. From a review of available information with respect to maternal-perinatal calcium interrelationships, I propose the following hypothesis: While total maternal serum calcium declines during pregnancy because of the physiologic hypoalbuminemia, the level of ionic calcium remains constant, in part, at least, because of increasing maternal PTH output. The placenta plays a primary role in fetal calcium metabolism by transporting calcium ions from the mother to the fetus against a concentration gradient. Relatively high fetal ionic calcium levels cause suppression of PTH and stimulation of CT in the fetus, facilitating growth of the fetal skeleton. With sudden loss of the placental source of calcium at birth, the newborn infant becomes functionally hypoparathyroid and/or hypercalcitonemic, and the serum calcium level declines until 3 to 4 days of life when PTH rises and CT falls with a resultant slight rise in calcium. A fall in the neonatal serum calcium level into the hypocalcemic range may result from: (1) a low initial fetal calcium which declines the normal amount, as in the premature infant; (2) an exaggeration of the maternal-fetal relationships, as in maternal hyperparathyroidism, with oversuppression of PTH and/or overstimulation of CT in the fetus; or (3) overstimulation of CT production or release by glucagon during the perinatal period. This hypothesis does not exclude other possible causes of early neonatal hypocalcemia. Renal factors, with impaired ability to excrete phosphate, may play a contributory role. In addition, recent data suggest maternal vitamin D deficiency as a possible pathogenetic mechanism. Hypocalcemia after the second day of life appears to be related principally to nutritional factors in the infant, although prenatal events may also have an influence.},

There were no significant differences in plasma calcium, phosphorus or magnesium concentrations before parturition but the blood ionised calcium and plasma chloride concentrations were significantly increased, together with a lower blood pH and acid-base excess in the cows on the acid diet. The mean 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations tended to increase before parturition in the cows on the acid diet compared with the alkali diet in experiment 1 and were significantly higher in experiment 2. At parturition, the acid-fed cows had higher mean plasma calcium concentrations and significantly more of them had values {\textgreater}2·0 mmol litre−1 than the alkali-fed groups, and the plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations were related to these different plasma calcium concentrations.

Cows in their second lactation or greater (n=927) from 2 large dairies in Wisconsin were enrolled during the summer of 2010. Both herds were fed supplemental anions during the prefresh period and less than 1\% of fresh cows were treated for clinical milk fever. Cows were scored before calving for lameness and body condition, and then randomly assigned to either a control group or an oral Ca bolus-supplemented group. Control cows received no oral Ca boluses around calving. Cows in the oral Ca bolus group received 2 oral Ca boluses (Bovikalc, Boehringer Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO), one bolus 0 to 2h after calving and the second 8 to 35 h after calving. The oral Ca bolus administration schedule allowed fresh cows to be restrained in headlocks only once daily. Whole-blood samples were collected immediately before the second oral Ca bolus was given and were analyzed for ionized Ca (Ca(2+)) concentration. Early-lactation health events were recorded and summed for each cow. Only 6 cases (0.6\% of calvings) of clinical milk fever occurred during the trial, and only 14\% of cows tested were hypocalcemic (Ca(2+) less than 1.0 mmol/L) at 8 to 35 h after calving. Mean Ca(2+) concentrations were not different between the control and oral Ca bolus-supplemented groups. Blood samples from the cows given oral Ca boluses were collected an average of 20.6 h after administration of the first bolus. Subpopulations of cows with significant responses to oral Ca bolus supplementation were identified based on significant interactions between oral Ca bolus supplementation and covariates in mixed multiple regression models. Lame cows supplemented with oral Ca boluses averaged 0.34 fewer health events in the first 30 d in milk compared with lame cows that were not supplemented with oral Ca boluses. Cows with a higher previous lactation mature-equivalent milk production (greater than 105\% of herd rank) and supplemented with oral Ca boluses produced 2.9 kg more milk at their first test after calving compared with cows with higher previous lactation milk yields that were not supplemented. Results of this study indicate that lame cows and higher producing cows responded favorably to supplementation with oral Ca boluses. Supplementing targeted subpopulations of cows with oral Ca boluses was beneficial even for dairies with a very low incidence of hypocalcemia.},

Logistic regression analysis revealed that dietary S had the greatest influence on the incidence of milk fever. Increasing dietary S concentrations lowered the odds ratio of developing milk fever. Increasing dietary Na and CP increased odds ratios, but to a lesser extent. Relationship of dietary Ca to milk fever was nonlinear; relative risk of milk fever was greatest at 1.16\% dietary Ca (DM basis) and was lowered as dietary Ca deviated either direction from 1.16\%. Except when dietary Ca was extremely high or low, effects of changes in dietary Ca on the risk of milk fever were minor. Results of the analysis clarified the influence of Ca on the relative risk for milk fever and supported the theory that anion-cation balance exerts a strong, linear effect on the incidence of this disorder.},

Furthermore, a strictly isoform-dependent VDAC2 function was revealed in the mitochondrial import and OMM-permeabilizing function of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, primarily Bak in many cell types. In addition, emerging evidence indicates a variety of other isoform-specific engagements for VDAC2. Since VDAC isoforms display 75\% sequence similarity, the distinctive structure underlying VDAC2-specific functions is an intriguing problem. In this paper we summarize studies of VDAC2 structure and functions, which suggest a fundamental and exclusive role for VDAC2 in health and disease.

In the early part of the season not only was the herbage concentration of calcium and phosphorus lower in grass which had received potash fertilizer but in addition the ‘availability’ of the calcium to cows was depressed. Grass which had received large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer had a comparatively low dry-matter content in the autumn. Cows fed such grass were in negative balance for calcium at this time. As expected high dietary potassium gave rise to high excretion of potassium in the urine which in turn was correlated with high excretion of magnesium. These various factors are likely to affect the incidence of metabolic disease.},

	abstract = {Magnesium is an essential mineral with many physiologic and biochemical functions. Surprisingly, Mg homeostasis is not regulated by a hormonal feedback system, but simply depends on inflow (absorption) from the gastrointestinal tract and outflow (endogenous secretion, requirement for milk production, uptake by tissues). Any surplus (inflow greater than outflow) is excreted via urine. Conversely, if the outflow (mainly milk secretion and endogenous loss) exceeds inflow, hypomagnesemia occurs because of the lack of hormonal mechanisms of homeostasis. The major reason for insufficient inflow is a reduced absorption of Mg from the forestomachs. Recent studies from our laboratory and data from the literature permit the proposal of a putative transport model for the secondary active transport of Mg across the rumen epithelium. This model includes two uptake mechanisms across the luminal membrane (PD-dependent and PD-independent) and basolateral extrusion via a Na/Mg exchange. The well-known negative interaction between ruminal K concentration and Mg absorption can be explained on the basis of this model: an increase of ruminal K depolarizes the potential difference of the luminal membrane, PDa, and as the driving force for PD-dependent (or K-sensitive) Mg uptake. Because Na deficiency causes an increase of K concentration in saliva and ruminal fluid, Na deficiency should be considered a potentially important risk factor. The data obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies on the association of Mg transport, changes of ruminal K concentration, and PDa are extensive and confirm the model, if the ruminal Mg concentrations are below 2 to 3 mM. It is further proposed by the model that the PD-independent Mg uptake mechanism is primarily working at high ruminal Mg concentration (above 2 mM). Mg absorption becomes more and more independent of ruminal K with increasing Mg concentration, which can be considered as an explanation for the well-known prophylaxis of hypomagnesemia by increasing oral Mg intake. Fermentation products, NH4+ and SCFA, influence Mg absorption. The possible meaning regarding the pathogenesis of hypomagnesemia is not quite clear. A sudden increase of ruminal NH4+ should be avoided, because high NH4+ concentrations transiently reduce Mg absorption. The most prominent signs of hypomagnesemia are excitations and muscle cramps, which are closely correlated with the Mg concentration in the CSF. It is suggested that the clinical signs are caused by spontaneous activation of neurons in the CNS at low Mg concentrations, which leads to tetany. Prophylactic measures are discussed in context with the known effects on ruminal Mg absorption.},

	abstract = {How hair-coated animals such as dairy cows synthesize endogenous vitamin D3 during exposure to summer sunlight has been unclear since vitamin D3 and its relation to sunlight was discovered. The fur of fur-bearing animals is thought to be comparable to clothing in humans, which prevents vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin during exposure to sunlight. Different scenarios have been suggested but never tested in cows; for example, that vitamin D3 is synthesized from sebum on the hair and ingested by cows during grooming or that body areas such as the udder and muzzle that have scant hair exclusively produce the vitamin. To test different scenarios, 16 Danish Holstein dairy cows were subjected to 4 degrees of coverage of their bodies with fabric that prevented vitamin D3 synthesis in the covered skin areas. The treatments were horse blanket (cows fitted with horse blankets), udder cover (cows fitted with udder covers, horse blanket + udder cover (cows fitted with both horse blankets and udder covers), and natural (cows without any coverage fitted). The cows were let out to pasture daily between 1000 and 1500 h for 4 wk in July and August 2009. Blood samples were collected 15 times during the study and analyzed for content of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] indicative of the animals’ vitamin D3 status. Results showed that uncovered cows had a higher 25(OH)D3 concentration in plasma after 28 d of access to sunlight compared with covered cows and that the plasma concentration of 25(OH)D3 was strongly inversely correlated to the body surface area covered. These results are consistent with findings in humans, wherein the vitamin D3 status of different individuals was inversely proportional to the amount of clothing worn during exposure to artificial sunlight. Hence, it appears that human clothing and cow hair are not comparable with respect to prevention of vitamin D3 synthesis and that cows, like humans, synthesize vitamin D3 evenly over their body surface. That vitamin D3 should be synthesized from sebum on the hair and obtained by cows as a result of grooming is not supported by the findings in the present study either, because large differences were found between the treatment groups. If grooming were the source of vitamin D3, then a relatively even 25(OH)D3 concentration between treatments would be expected, because covered cows would obtain vitamin D3 by grooming uncovered herdmates.},

Another major risk factor for milk fever is hypomagnesemia, which is observed when animals are fed inadequate amounts of magnesium, or some factor is present in the diet that prevents adequate absorption of magnesium.

Twenty-one healthy horses at pasture were included; 5 were covered with standard horse blankets including neck rugs. Blood samples were collected for 13 mo and analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D), ionized calcium (iCa), total calcium (tCa), phosphorus (P), total magnesium (tMg), and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Grass and hay samples were collected and analyzed for vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Climate data were also collected. The serum concentration of 25OHD3 in horses was either undetectable or below the detection limit of the assay, and the main form of 25OHD was 25OHD2. No differences in serum 25OHD2, 1,25(OH)2D, iCa, tCa, P, tMg, and PTH (P ≥ 0.05) concentrations were seen between the 2 groups. Associations were seen between iCa and PTH (P \&lt; 0.05), iCa and tMg (P \&lt; 0.05), and dietary vitamin D and 25OHD2 (P \&lt; 0.05). A strong seasonal trend was seen in serum 25OHD2 (P \&lt; 0.0001), which was higher during spring and summer when the amount of sunshine and UV radiation was higher. Parathyroid hormone and 1,25(OH)2D showed opposing trends with PTH higher in winter whereas 1,25(OH)2D was higher in summer. The results suggest that dietary vitamin D may be necessary for horses to fulfill their vitamin D requirements; however, further research is required to determine the contribution of vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin to the vitamin D status of the horse.},

	abstract = {Subclinical hypocalcemia may affect half of all multiparous cows, and clinical hypocalcemia or milk fever affects approximately 5\% of dairy cows each year. This disorder of calcium homeostasis can be induced by several dietary factors. Recent studies implicate high dietary potassium and high dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) with increased risk of milk fever. The hypothesis tested in this study was that high-DCAD diets fed to prepartum cows reduce tissue sensitivity to parathyroid hormone (PTH), inducing a pseudohypoparathyroid state that diminishes calcium homeostatic responses. Multiparous Jersey cows were fed low- or high-DCAD diets in late gestation, creating a compensated metabolic alkalosis in the high-DCAD cows and a compensated metabolic acidosis in the low-DCAD cows. They then received synthetic PTH injections at 3-h intervals for 48 h. Parathyroid hormone is expected to cause an increase in plasma calcium by increasing renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and increasing bone calcium resorption. Plasma calcium concentration increased at a significantly lower rate in cows fed the high-DCAD diet. Cows fed the high-DCAD diet also produced significantly less 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in response to the PTH injections than cows fed the low-DCAD diet. Serum concentrations of the bone resorption marker carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen were numerically lower in cows fed the high-DCAD diet but this difference was not statistically significant. These data provide direct evidence that high-DCAD diets reduce tissue sensitivity to PTH. The metabolic alkalosis associated with high-DCAD diets likely induces a state of pseudohypoparathyroidism in some dairy cows at the onset of lactation, resulting in hypocalcemia and milk fever.},

	abstract = {Summary
About 50,000 cows in the County of Skaraborg in south-western Sweden were checked for puerperal paresis during 1967 and 1968. The cows belonged to herds employing AI. The SRB breed (Swedish Red and White) constituted 85\% and the Swedish Friesian (SLB) breed 15\% of the material. Practising veterinarians reported cases of puerperal paresis and collected blood samples for analysis of serum calcium. For various reasons all cases were not reported and so the incidence figures are probably too low, at least in the second year of investigation. About 90\% of the clinical cases showed calcium values {\textless} 8 mg. \% (hypocalcaemia). The risk of disease varied between age groups. These Ca values include debut cases (the first attack of disease in life) and repeat cases (recurrence at a later calving). The risk of a debut could be calculated separately and increased almost curvilinearly from 0.2\% at 3 years of age to 18\% at 11 years.The frequency of secondary cases (repeated treatment in the same period of disease) was about 20\% in the SRB breed and lower in the SLB.Serum calcium values for paretic cows of different ages decreased with age and there was a significant variation between the daughter groups of different bulls.The heritability of puerperal paresis was calculated both in different age groups and in the total material after correction for age variation. The latter calculation gave the value 12.8\% for clinical paresis in SRB and 9.7\% for hypocalcaemia. The corresponding values for SLB were 6.9 and 6.2\%. This suggests that it is generally advantageous to consider this disease in selection. The low incidence in younger animals makes it difficult to consider the disease at progeny testing but when selecting sires for bulls it should be possible to do so. There was a positive correlation between the F-value (breeding value for milk production) of the bulls and the incidence of paresis of their daughter groups.No correlation could be found between the incidence of paresis and the fertility of the daughter groups.
Zusammenfassung
Gebärparese und Hypocalcämie beim Rind Statistische und genetische UntersuchungenUngefähr 50 000 Kühe aus der Grafschaft Skaraborg in Südwest-Schweden wurden 1967/68 auf Gebärparese untersucht. Die Kühe gehörten zu Herden, die künstlich besamt wurden. 85\% der Tiere waren schwedische Rotbunte und 15\% schwedische Friesen. Die in der Gegend praktizierenden Tierärzte meldeten die beobachteten Fälle von Gebärparese und sammelten Blutproben zur Bestimmung des Serum-Calciums.Aus verschiedenen Gründen wurden besonders im 2. Jahr der Untersuchung nicht alle Fälle gemeldet, so daß die erhaltenen Zahlen etwas zu niedrig sind. Etwa 90\% aller klinisch manifesten Fälle zeigten Ca-Werte unter 8 mg \%, d. h. eine Hypocalcämie. Das Risiko einer Erkrankung war in den verschiedenen Altersklassen unterschiedlich. Das Risiko einer erstmaligen Erkrankung stieg von 0,2\% im 3. Lebensjahr auf 18\% im 11. Jahr.Die Häufigkeit von Rezidiven mit wiederholter Behandlung betrug etwa 20\% bei den Rotbunten und etwas weniger bei den Friesenkühen. Die Ca-Werte des Serums von erkrankten Tieren nahmen mit zunehmendem Alter ab, wobei zwischen den Nachkommen verschiedener Stiere signifikante Unterschiede bestanden.Die Heritabilität der Gebärparese wurde sowohl in den verschiedenen Altersgruppen, als auch im gesamten Tiermaterial nach Korrektur der Altersvariationen berechnet. Die Berechnung für alle untersuchten Tiere der rotbunten Rasse ergab eine Heritabilität von 12,8\% für klinische Gebärparese und 9,7\% für eine Hypocalcämie. Die entsprechenden Werte für die Friesenkühe waren 6,9 und 6,2\%.Auf Grund dieser Zahlen scheint es vorteilhaft, die Gebärparese bei der Zuchtwahl zu berücksichtigen. Das seltene Vorkommen dieser Krankheit bei jungen Tieren macht jedoch eine Nachkommenprüfung schwierig. Dennoch sollte bei der Auswahl der Eltern der Zuchtbullen daran gedacht werden.Eine positive Korrelation bestand zwischen dem F-Wert (Zuchtwert für Milchleistung) der Stiere und der Häufigkeit der Erkrankung an Gebärparese bei deren Töchter.Keine Korrelation hingegen fanden die Autoren zwischen Häufigkeit der Erkrankung und Fruchtbarkeit.
Résumé
Fièvre vitulaire et hypocalcémie des bovins Investigation statistique et génétiqueOn examine en 1967/68 environ 50 000 vaches du comté de Skaraborg dans le sud-ouest de la Suède, au sujet de la fièvre vitulaire. Les vaches appartenaient à des troupeaux, où se pratiquait l'insémination artificielle. 85\% des animaux appartenaient à la race pie rouge suédoise et 15\% à la race frisonne suédoise. Les vétérinaires praticiens de la région signalaient les cas de fièvre vitulaire et recueillaient des échantillons sanguins pour la détermination du calcium sérique. Les cas n'ont pas tous été signalés, principalement au cours de la deuxième année, pour des risons diverses, de sorte que les résultats obtenus sont probablement un peu trop faibles. Environ 90\% des cas cliniques présentaient des valeurs de calcium en dessous de 8 mg \%, indiquant une hypocalcémie. Les risques de maladie varient avec l'âge. Les valeurs du calcium comprennent les cas débutant (première atteinte de la maladie) et les récidives aux mises bas suivantes. Le risque d'un début de maladie passe de 0,2\% (à 3 ans) à 18\% (à 11 ans). La fréquence des récidives, avec répétition du traitement, est d'environ 20\% chez les pies rouges et un peu plus faible chez les vaches frisonnes. Les taux du calcium sérique diminuent avec l'âge chez les animaux malades et l'on observe des différences significatives entre les descendants des différents taureaux.On calcule la probabilité héréditaire de la fièvre vitulaire dans les différentes catégories d'âge et dans le matériel animal complet, après correction des variations dues à l'âge. Pour tous les animaux examinés de la race pie rouge, on trouve une probabilité héréditaire de 12,8\% pour la fièvre vitulaire et de 9,7\% pour l'hypocalcémie. Pour les vaches frisonnes, on trouve des valeurs correspondantes de 6,9 et 6,2\%.Sur la base de ces résultats, il nous paraît indiqué de tenir compte de la fièvre vitulaire dans la sélection. L'incidence faible de cette maladie chez les animaux jeunes la rend difficile à détecter lors d'un examen de la descendance. Enfin, il faudrait songer à ce problème lors du choix des parents des taureaux d'élevage.On trouve une corrélation positive entre la valeur F des taureaux (valeur d'élevage pour la production laitière) et la fréquence de la fièvre vitulaire chez leurs filles. On ne trouve pas de corrélation entre la fréquence de la maladie et la fertilité de la descendance.
Resumen
Paresia puerperal clínica e hipocalcemia en la vaca Pesquisas estadísticas y genéticasSe examinaron unas 50.000 vacas de la provincia de Skaraborg, en el suroeste de Suecia, en cuanto a la presentación de paresia puerperal durante 1967 y 1968. Dichas vacas pertenecían a ganaderías asociadas a los centros de IAG. El 85\% de los animales eran de la raza sueca berrenda en rojo (SRB) y el 15\% de la frisona sueca (SLB). Los veterinarios clínicos que practicaban en la región comunicaban los casos observados de paresia puerperal y tomaban muestras de sangre para valorar el calcio sérico. Por razones varias no se llegaron a comunicar todos los casos habidos, en especial durante el segundo año de la investigación, de modo que los valores obtenidos son algo bajos. Casi el 90\% de todos los casos clínicos manifiestos mostraban valores de calcemia inferiores a 8 mg. \%, es decir una hipocalcemia. El riesgo de enfermedad varía entre los distintos grupos de edades. El peligro del début aumentaba curvilíneamente del 0,2\% en el tercer año de vida al 18\% a la edad de 11 años.La frecuencia de recidivas con tratamientos repetidos era de un 20\% en el ganado berrendo en rojo y algo menor en el frisón. Los valores cálcicos del suero de vacas disminuían al aumentar la edad, existiendo variaciones significantes entre los grupos de hijas de los diferentes toros.La heredabilidad de la paresia puerperal se calculó tanto en los diferentes grupos de edades como en el material animal total después de efectuar la corrección por la variación de edad. El cálculo para todas las vacas de la raza berrenda en rojo dió la heredabilidad de 12,8\% para la paresia clínica y de 9,7\% para la hipocalcemia. Los valores correspondientes para las vacas frisonas eran 6,9 y 6,2\%.En atención a estas cifras, parece ventajoso considerar la paresia puerperal en la selección zootécnica. Sin embargo, la rara presencia de esta enfermedad en los animales jóvenes dificulta el control de la descendencia. Con todo esto, debería pensarse en lo mismo al seleccionar los progenitores de los toros.Existía una correlación positiva entre el valor F (valor zootécnico para la producción láctea) de los toros y la incidencia de paresia en los grupos de sus hijas.No se logró hallar correlación entre la frecuencia de paresia post partum y la fertilidad de los grupos de hijas.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to evaluate utilization of dietary minerals and trace elements in pregnant heifers with distinct residual feed intakes (RFI). Feed intake, body weight (BW), and body composition traits were recorded in 36 crossbred heifers over a period of 37 wk, starting shortly after weaning at 8.3 (0.10; standard deviation) mo of age with an average BW of 276 (7.8) kg. Both BW and body composition were monitored regularly throughout the study, whereas individual feed intake was assessed during the last 84 d of the trial. Data recorded were used to calculate RFI for each heifer. Heifers were ranked based on RFI and assigned to high (n = 14) or low (n = 10) RFI groups. After the RFI study, 24 selected heifers [age 18.2 (0.14) mo; 87.5 (4.74) d in gestation; 497 (8.5) kg of BW] were used in an indirect digestibility trial (lignin as internal marker). Heifers were fed a ration containing corn silage, haylage, and a mineral premix in which Ca, P, K, Na, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, Zn, and Co were provided in the diet according to National Research Council requirements of pregnant replacement heifers. The digestibility trial lasted 1 wk, during which samples of feces were gathered twice daily, and blood and liver biopsy samples were collected on the last day. We noted no significant differences between low- and high-RFI heifers in dry matter digestibility. Apparent absorption of Cu, Zn, and Mn was increased in heifers with low RFI, and apparent absorption of Co tended to be greater for these animals. Concentrations of macrominerals and trace elements in serum of pregnant heifers were similar for both groups except for Se, which was increased in the serum of low-RFI heifers. Liver concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn did not differ between low- and high-RFI heifers. In conclusion, whereas improved absorption of some trace elements (Cu, Zn, Mn, and Co) and increased Se serum concentration appear to be associated with superior feed efficiency in pregnant heifers, further studies are needed to investigate the causality of such relationships.},

In addition, CaPO4 are necessary for both animals and plants as the source of important chemical elements. Obviously, these well known facts have not become apparent immediately; thus, the purpose of this article is to provide the detailed annals of the knowledge development on CaPO4. The chosen time scale started with the earliest available studies of shortly before 1770s (to the best of my findings, CaPO4 had been unknown before), passed through the entire nineteenth century and finished in 1950, because since then the amount of publications rapidly increased and the subject became too broad. In addition, since publications of the second half of the twentieth century are easily accessible, other scientists have already reviewed the substantial amount of them. Many forgotten and poorly known historical facts, names, approaches, concepts, and misconceptions have been extracted from the old publications. To maximize objectivity, an extensive quotation has been used. Then the old data have been systematized, reanalyzed, and reconsidered from the modern points of view. The reported historical findings clearly demonstrate that many famous scientists of the past contributed to the subject. Furthermore, the significant quantity of the modern scientific facts, ideas, and experimental approaches appear to have been known for very many decades and, in fact, a good deal of the recent investigations on CaPO4 is just either a further development of the earlier studies or a rediscovery of the already forgotten knowledge.},

The coefficient of correlation between percentage ash (of dry bone) and scan density (milligrams per centimeter length of bone) measurements for treatment effects was .986. The coefficient of variation was about the same for the bone ash (5.8) and the three-point bone scan (6.9) methods. As indicated by the F ratio for testing treatment effects, bone densitometry was better able to detect differences among phosphorus sources. A technician may scan 50 cleaned bones in 3 hr, but with the bone ash method, drying, ashing, and weighing may require 3 working days. Bone sampling technique, multiple operators, different bone sizes, and decay of iodine source were the major factors affecting precision of the bone densitometry technique. Relative biological availabilities of phosphorus from various supplements were about the same by the two methods.},

The level of calcium intake was without effect on the number of lambs born, birth weight, or growth while milk fed.3. Blood calcium was significantly lower in group A than in groups B and C, but blood inorganic phosphorus was unaltered.4. The resorption of bone substance was greater in group A than in groups B and C.5. The severity of resorption varied between bones, and in regions within certain bones. Resorption was most severe in the vertebrae and pelvis, and only slight in the metacarpal, the metatarsal and the shafts of other long bones. Resorption of intermediate magnitude was found for the remainder of the skeleton.6. Resorption was accompanied by reductions in the percentages of ash in bones, but this effect was proportionately less than the ash weight reduction.7. Radiological observations made on flesh-free bones at the end of the experiment gave a picture of resorption similar to that presented by the data for ash weights and percentages of ash, namely that resorption was much greater in group A than in groups B and C.},

In both cell types, small increases in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ evoked transient followed by sustained increases in [Ca2+]i, as measured with fura-2. Increases in [Ca2+]i obtained by raised extracellular Ca2+ were associated with a stimulation of secretion of calcitonin (CT) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rMTC cells, but an inhibition of secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in parathyroid cells. The Ca2+ channel agonist (+)202-791 stimulated whereas the antagonist (−)202-791 inhibited both transient and sustained increases in [Ca2+]i induced by extracellular Ca2+ in rMTC cells. Secretion of CT and CGRP was correspondingly enhanced and depressed by (+)202-791 and (−)202-791, respectively. In contrast, neither the agonist nor the antagonist affected [Ca2+]i and PTH secretion in parathyroid cells. Depolarizing concentrations of extracellular K+ increased [Ca2+]i and hormone secretion in rMTC cells and both these responses were potentiated or inhibited by the Ca2+ channel agonist or antagonist, respectively. The results suggest a major role of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ influx in the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ and hormone secretion in rMTC cells. Parathyroid cells, on the other hand, appear to lack voltage-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathways and regulate PTH secretion by some alternative mechanism.},

PTH-LP messenger RNA is expressed in mammary tissue only during lactation; it appears and disappears rapidly (2 to 4 hours) as a function of the sucking stimulus. The identity of this messenger RNA was confirmed by cloning the rat PTH-LP complementary DNA, which predicts a peptide with strong similarity to the human homolog. Moreover, extracts from lactating mammary tissue stimulated parathyroid hormone-dependent adenylate cyclase. These findings suggest that PTH-LP plays a physiological role in lactation, possibly as a hormone for the mobilization or transfer (or both) of calcium to the milk.},

	abstract = {Due to the importance of Ca2+ in the regulation of vital cellular and tissue functions, the concentration of Ca2+ in body fluids is closely guarded by an efficient feedback control system. This system includes Ca2+-transporting subsystems (bone, intestine, and kidney), Ca2+ sensing, possibly by a calcium-sensing receptor, and calcium-regulating hormones (parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcitonin [CT], and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]). In humans and birds, acute Ca2+ perturbations are handled mainly by modulation of kidney Ca2+ reabsorption and by bone Ca2+ flow under PTH and possibly CT regulation, respectively. Chronic perturbations are also handled by the more sluggish but economic regulatory action of 1,25(OH)2D3 on intestinal calcium absorption. Peptide hormone secretion is modulated by Ca2+ and several secretagogues. The hormones' signal is produced by interaction with their respective receptors, which evokes the cAMP and phospholipase C-IP3-Ca2+ signal transduction pathways. 1,25(OH)2D3 operates through a cytoplasmic receptor in controlling transcription and through a membrane receptor that activates the Ca2+ and phospholipase C messenger system. The calciotropic hormones also influence processes not directly associated with Ca2+ regulation, such as cell differentiation, and may thus affect the calcium-regulating subsystems also indirectly.},

Marked increases in both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor and alkaline phosphatase activities were seen towards the end of pregnancy but the time course of these changes was not synchronous. Receptor activity was first detectable at 11 days of pregnancy with a marked rise in receptor levels at 3 days post-partum. Changes in alkaline phosphatase activity more closely correlated with casein production and peak activity was observed at the time of parturition.

We conclude that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor content increases during pregnancy and lactation and may be involved in maintaining milk calcium concentration.},

The apparent calcium absorption ratio and the calcium contents of the femur and tibia in gastrectomized rats fed the control diet were significantly less than those in sham-operated rats. In the gastrectomized rats, the apparent calcium absorption ratio and the calcium contents of bone in the rats fed the lower doses of LA diets (LA 0.5 or 1.0 g/100 g of diet) were not affected; however, the apparent calcium absorption ratio and the calcium contents of bone in the rats fed the highest doses of LA diet (LA 2.5 g/100 g of diet) were greater than those in gastrectomized rats fed the control diet. Dietary LA (2.5 g/100 g of diet) also enhanced the phosphorus absorption and bone phosphorus content in the gastrectomized rats. We speculated that the highest dose of dietary LA might be associated with the dissolving of a water-insoluble form of calcium salt in the diet, thereby facilitating the calcium absorption and resulting in increased bone calcium content in gastrectomized rats.},

The hallmarks of milk-secreting cells include the assembly and secretion of lipid droplets coated with cellular membranes, synthesis of lactose, which indirectly regulates the secretion of water, and the assembly of caseins with calcium and phosphate into micellar aggregates. Milk constituents are either synthesized in the mammary gland or transported across the epithelial barrier from other sources. At least five major pathways have been identified: (1) secretion of membrane-coated lipid droplets from the apical surface; (2) packaging of most skim milk proteins, lactose, ions, and water in secretory vesicles, followed by secretion from the apical plasma membrane by exocytosis; (3) transport of proteins, including immunoglobulins and peptide hormones, from other sources by transcytosis; (4) equilibration of ions and water across the interstitial space, cell cytoplasm, and milk by specific transporters; and (5) paracellular transit of material between cells when the epithelial tight junctions are permeable, for example, during late pregnancy, late lactation, and at times of bacterial inflammation. In addition, membrane-bounded vesicles containing cytoplasmic proteins, called ‘exosomes,’ may be released from the apical surface by poorly characterized mechanisms.},

The program incorporated a negative-feedback entry of Ca2+ at the brush-border membrane that was characterized by an inhibitor constant of 0.5 microM cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]). The basolateral Ca(2+)-ATPase was simulated by a four-step mechanism that resulted in Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant of 0.24 microM [Ca2+]. The cytosolic diffusion of Ca2+ was simulated by dividing the cytosol into 10 slabs of equal width. Ca2+ binding to calbindin-D9K was simulated in each slab, and diffusion of free Ca2+, free calbindin, and Ca(2+)-laden calbindin was simulated between each slab. The cytosolic [Ca2+] of the simulated cells was regulated within the physiological range. Calbindin-D9K reduced the cytosolic [Ca2+] gradient, increased Ca2+ entry into the cell by removing the negative-feedback inhibition of Ca2+ entry, increased cytosolic Ca2+ flow, and increased the efflux of Ca2+ across the basolateral membrane by increasing the free [Ca2+] immediately adjacent to the pump. The enhancement of transcellular Ca2+ transport was nearly linearly dependent on calbindin-D9K concentration. The values of the dissociation constant (Kd) for calbindin-D9K were previously obtained experimentally in the presence and absence of KCl. Calbindin with the Kd obtained in the presence of KCl enhanced the simulated Ca2+ transport more than with the Kd obtained in the absence of KCl. This result suggests that the physiological Kd of calbindin is optimal for the enhancement of transcellular Ca2+ transport. The simulated Ca2+ flow was less than that predicted from the "near-equilibrium" analytic solution of the reaction-diffusion problem.},

Thus this paper focuses first on the nature and regulation of the two enzymes responsible for the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), the 25-hydroxylase in the liver and the 1α-hydroxylase in the kidney. The most important regulators of the 1α-hydroxylase in the kidney are 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) itself, parathyroid hormone and FGF23. The extent and importance of extra-renal, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) synthesis is then considered. Finally the features of the 24R-hydroxylase, which produces 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in the kidney and is induced by and inactivated, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)in target cells are described.},

	abstract = {Calcium absorption from the intestine involves two sets of events. One, a saturable transcellular process is regulated by vitamin D via its molecular product, the calcium-binding protein (CaBP, MW = 8800). This transcellular movement is largely confined to the proximal portion of the intestine. The second process is nonsaturable, occurs throughout the length of the intestine and is paracellular. Evidence in support of these statements is discussed, with emphasis on kinetic considerations. It is proposed that CaBP acts as a ferry, amplifying the intracellular movement of calcium by a factor of about 60, thereby enabling transcellular calcium transport to reach the measured values of Vm = 22 mumol/h per gram (wet) duodenum, with Km = 3.9 mM. The transcellular process is subject to down-regulation and is influenced by functional or nutritional factors such as age or calcium intake. The nonsaturable process, on the other hand, is not directly influenced by these or related events. Vitamin D therapy alters active calcium transport, but may lead to undesirable effects at other target organs, e.g., kidney or bone. An increase in calcium intake is the simplest method for increasing the amount absorbed. Future research may show whether paracellular pathway alterations are a practical approach to changing the amount of calcium absorbed by the nonsaturable process.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary forage proportion and P content on fecal P excretion. Four dietary treatments were formed in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. The P content was 0.33 or 0.42\%, and the forage proportion was 48 or 58\% on a dry matter (DM) basis. The neutral detergent fiber content was 27 and 30\% for the low and high forage diets, respectively. The P amount was varied by using monosodium phosphate, and the forage amount by changing the proportions of alfalfa silage and corn. The diets were fed to 44 midlactation Holsteins for 14 wk. Fecal P excretion was estimated using Cr marker and grab sampling. Dietary P content did not affect DM intake, milk yield, or milk composition. The P intake averaged 74 and 96 g/d and fecal P averaged 0.69 and 0.92\% (DM basis) or 49 and 65 g/d for the low and high P diets, respectively. Thus, reducing dietary P from 0.42 to 0.33\% resulted in approximately 25\% less estimated fecal P excretion. Increasing dietary forage reduced milk yield (34.0 vs. 36.5 kg/d), but increased milk fat content (3.66 vs. 3.25\%). Estimated apparent digestibility of P tended to decrease (31.1 vs. 36.6\%) when the forage proportion increased, but most of the change occurred when the diets contained the low amount of P. Overall, the effect of forage proportion on estimated fecal P excretion was small when diets contained 48 or 58\% forage, varied by alfalfa silage. Phosphorus intake has a much larger impact on fecal P excretion than forage proportion, and it does not seem necessary to adjust the dietary P content according to the forage proportion to provide the same amount of absorbed P.},

The data were generated from total collection digestion trials. The only sources of supplemental P used were dicalcium phosphate and monosodium phosphate. The concentration of dietary P ranged from 0.34 to 0.45\% of dry matter (DM). Cows varied in milk production (8 to 59 kg/d), DM intake (12.4 to 30.5 kg/d), and P intake (45 to 133 g/d). Apparent digestibility of P averaged 40.4\%, fecal output of P averaged 47 g/d, and apparent P retention averaged 4 g/d. Two equations were derived to estimate excretion of P via manure (g/d): 1) Manure P = −2.5 + 0.64 × P intake, and 2) Manure P = 7.5 + 0.78 × P intake − 0.702 × Milk; where P intake is in g/d and milk is kg/d. Both equations were evaluated using literature data, and both equations had acceptable accuracy for field use. The requirements for P of lactating dairy cows from the National Research Council (NRC) were also evaluated, and for most diets, those requirements were adequate based on retention of P.},

	abstract = {Five ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows, fitted with permanent indwelling catheters in the mesenteric vein, hepatic vein, portal vein, and an artery were used to study intestinal absorption and net recycling of inorganic phosphate (Pi) to the gastrointestinal tract. Treatments were low P (LP; 2.4 g of P/kg of DM) and high P (HP; 3.4 g of P/kg of DM). The dietary total P (tP) concentrations were obtained by replacing 0.50\% calcium carbonate in the LP diet with 0.50\% monocalcium phosphate in the HP diet. Diets were fed for 14 d and cows were sampled on d 14 in each period. Cows were fed restrictively, resulting in equal dry matter intakes as well as milk, fat, and protein yields between treatments. Net Pi recycling (primarily salivary) was estimated as the difference between net portal plasma flux (net absorption of Pi) and apparently digested tP (feed – fecal tP difference). Phosphorus intake, apparently digested tP, and fecal tP excretion decreased with LP. An effect of decreased tP intake on net portal plasma flux of Pi could not be detected. However, despite numerically minute net fluxes across the liver, the net splanchnic flux of Pi was less in LP compared with that in HP. Though arterial plasma Pi concentration decreased, net Pi recycling was not decreased when tP intake was decreased, and recycling of Pi was maintained at the expense of deposition of Pi in bones. Data are not consistent with salivary Pi secretion being the primary regulator of Pi homeostasis at low tP intakes. On the contrary, maintaining salivary Pi recycling at low tP intakes indicates that rumen function was prioritized at the expense of bone P reserves.},

	abstract = {The objective was to evaluate estimates of the inevitable fecal loss component of the P maintenance requirement of lactating Holstein cows consuming differing amounts of a low-P diet. The maintenance requirement for P is the sum of inevitable (e.g., unavoidable) endogenous fecal P plus endogenous urinary P when an animal is fed near its true P requirement (i.e., zero P balance). Urinary excretion of P is normally very low in healthy cattle. Inevitable fecal P is the main part of the total P maintenance requirement; it can be expressed as grams of fecal P/kilogram of dry matter intake (DMI). Twenty-one multiparous lactating Holstein cows (55 to 253 ± 6 d in milk, range ± SD; 0 to 171 ± 64 d pregnant) with a wide range of pretrial milk yields (25.3 to 47.3 ± 1.23 kg/cow per day) were selected to achieve a range in DMI and assigned to treatment groups of low, medium, and high DMI. To obtain an even greater range in DMI, rations fed to cows in the low and medium treatment groups were restricted to 75 and 50\% of their pretrial ad libitum intakes, respectively. Dry matter intakes during the experiment averaged 11.3 (low), 15.3 (medium), and 25.1 (high) kg/cow per d, respectively. All cows were fed the same low-P diet (0.26\% P, dry basis) throughout the experiment. Phosphorus balances of cows in all treatments were not different from zero and unaffected by DMI. Average daily total inevitable fecal P excretion was 15.3, 18.2, and 26.3 g/cow for low, medium, and high DMI, respectively. Inevitable fecal P excretion was 1.36, 1.19, and 1.04 g/kg of DMI for low, medium, and high and decreased linearly with increasing DMI. The regression equation to estimate inevitable fecal P excretion across the range of DMI was: (g/d) = [0.85 ± 0.070 (g/d)] × DMI (kg/d) + [5.30 ± 1.224 (g/d)]; (R2 = 0.90).

	abstract = {A study was carried out to verify the effect of Ca and P levels on production, digestibility, and serum bone metabolism biomarkers in dairy cows. Fifty-two nonlactating multiparous cows (≥3 lactations) were confined in a free-stall barn approximately 20 d before calving. A standard close-up diet was fed to cows once daily until d 2 postpartum. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial approach averaging 0.64\% Ca for high Ca (HCa), 0.46\% Ca for low Ca (LCa), 0.47\% P for high P (HP), and 0.38\% P for low P (LP) on a dry matter basis. Experimental diets were fed twice daily from 3 d in milk (DIM) until 31 DIM. Intake and milk yield were recorded daily. Milk samples were collected on d 28, 29, and 30 postpartum for components analyses. Blood samples were drawn 10 d before expected calving, at calving, and at 15 and 30 DIM for serum analyses of osteocalcin, a biomarker of bone accretion, and pyridinoline, a biomarker of bone resorption. Total fecal collection was conducted when cows in a block averaged 20 DIM. Intake and production traits were not significantly affected by any of the dietary treatments. Cows averaged nearly 21 kg/d dry matter intake and 44 kg/d milk yield from 6 to 31 DIM. There were no significant differences across treatments in body weight or body condition score loss. Phosphorus intake, P fecal output, P digestibility, and P apparent absorption were affected by dietary P content. Calcium intake was higher with HCa, but Ca fecal output, digestibility, and apparent absorption showed an interaction between dietary Ca and dietary P. Calcium fecal output was 100.6 g/d for cows fed HCaHP, intermediate for cows on the HCaLP diet (89 g/d), and similar among cows fed the 2 LCa diets (70 g/d with LCaHP and 75 with LCaLP). There was no significant effect of Ca or P on osteocalcin measurements. Pyridinoline concentrations were affected by dietary Ca levels and tended to have a significant dietary Ca × dietary P interaction. Phosphorus apparent digestibility occurred independently of dietary Ca levels. Results of this study suggest that more bone was mobilized in cows fed LCa diets, but excess dietary P caused greater and prolonged bone mobilization regardless of dietary Ca content.},

	abstract = {PTH-related protein-(107-139) [PTHrP-(107-139)] has been reported previously to be a potent inhibitor of osteoclast activity. However, this finding has not been reproduced in other in vitro models. We have now examined the effects of this peptide in an in vivo model, employing intact adult mice. Four groups of eight male mice were given injections of either vehicle or one of three doses of PTHrP-(107-139) (4 x 10(-13), 4 x 10(-11), or 4 x 10(-9) mol) over the periosteum of the right hemicalvaria for 5 consecutive days. The animals were killed 1 week after the last injection. There were significant decreases in bone resorption indexes after all doses of PTHrP-(107-139), with a 70\% decrease in osteoclast number (P {\textless} 0.001), a 70\% decrease in osteoclast perimeter (P = 0.004) and a 50\% decrease in eroded perimeter (P = 0.001). In addition, some indexes of bone formation were significantly decreased, with 40\% decreases in both osteoblast number (P = 0.05) and osteoblast perimeter (P = 0.02), but no significant change in osteoid area. There was a dose-related upward trend in mineralized bone area, reaching 12\% at the highest dose, but this was not statistically significant. It is concluded that PTHrP-(107-139) is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption in vivo. As this model is very dissimilar to that of isolated osteoclasts, in which this peptide is also active, the present findings suggest that osteoclast inhibition is an authentic action of the C-terminus of PTHrP, which may, therefore, play a role in the regulation of bone turnover in vivo.},

	abstract = {PTH-related peptide (PTH-rP) has recently been discovered to exist in high concentrations in milk. The development of a commercial RIA for PTH-rP has allowed us to extend these studies. We measured the PTH-rP content of milk from 42 Jersey cows from a single farm in various stages of lactation. Colostrum (first milk) contained 56 +/- 12 ng/ml immunoreactive PTH-rP (iPTH-rP). The iPTH-rP contents of milk 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 months into lactation were 77 +/- 19, 59 +/- 14, 57 +/- 10, 106 +/- 11, 119 +/- 16, and 168 +/- 17 ng/ml, respectively. Plasma was obtained from 7 Jersey calves at birth and at intervals after the ingestion of colostrum. No iPTH-rP was detected in the plasma at birth. Two hours after the ingestion of colostrum, the iPTH-rP content of plasma was 81 +/- 25 pg/ml. The plasma iPTH-rP concentration continued to increase to 384 +/- 84 pg/ml at 7 h and peaked at 444 +/- 84 pg/ml 12 h after birth. Two calves were sampled through the 60th hour after birth, at which time plasma iPTH-rP was 483 +/- 36 pg/ml. The biological activity of the PTH-rP in milk and plasma was assessed by its ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation in ROS 17/2.8 cells. The specificity of this response was determined by the ability of antiserum to PTH-rP to block the activity. The biological activity of the milk samples was between 31-95\% of the activity suggested by immunoassay. Biologically active PTH-rP could not be detected in any of the calf plasma samples. These results confirm the presence of biologically active PTH-rP in milk and suggest that the iPTH-rP is capable of being absorbed. However, our results indicate that the biological activity of the PTH-rP is nearly completely absent once in the systemic circulation.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis investigation based on literature data was conducted to estimate the effect size of nutritional and animal factors on phosphorus (P) excretion in feces and concentrations of P in milk. Two data sets were created for statistical analysis: One to derive prediction equations for P in feces (25 studies; 130 treatments) and another for P in milk (19 studies; 94 treatments). Prediction equations were derived using mixed model regression analysis with a random effect for study, and equations were evaluated based on values for Bayesian information criterion (BIC), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) statistics. In terms of RMSPE and CCC values, fecal P excretion was best predicted by P intake, where P in feces (g/d) = −3.8(±3.45) + 0.64(±0.038) × P intake (g/d) (RMSPE: 18.3\%, CCC: 0.869). However, significant effects of crude protein [g/kg of dry matter (DM)], neutral detergent fiber (g/kg of DM), and milk yield (kg/d) on fecal P excretion were also found. Despite a lack of improvement in terms of RMSPE and CCC values, these parameters may still explain part of the variation in fecal P excretion. For milk P, expressed as a fraction of P intake, the following equation had the highest CCC and the lowest RMSPE value: P in milk as a fraction of P intake (g/g) = 0.42(±0.065) + 0.23(±0.018) × feed efficiency (i.e., fat- and protein-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) − 0.11(±0.0199) × P in feed (g/kg of DM) (RMSPE: 19.7\%; CCC: 0.761). Equations derived to predict fecal P as a fraction of P intake (g/g) or milk P content (g/kg) could not adequately explain the observed variation and did not perform well in terms of RMSPE and CCC values. Examination of the residuals showed that P balance was a seemingly confounding factor in some of the models. The results presented here can be used to estimate P in feces and milk based on commonly measured dietary and milk variables, but could also be used to guide development of mechanistic models on P metabolism in lactating dairy cattle. Factors to consider in future research and modeling efforts regarding efficiency of P use include the effects of dietary neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, starch, variation in P content of milk, and effects of P resorption from bone and body tissues during early lactation.},

Eighteen of the cows were separated into 2 groups: low-parity (LP, n = 8) cows if they were in their first or second pregnancy and high-parity (HP, n = 10) cows if they were in their third or greater pregnancy. Blood samples were collected from each cow on 1 occasion, 15 to 5 days before calving, and blood and milk samples were collected daily during 6 days after calving. Serum total and ionized calcium (Ca(tot) and Ca2+, respectively) and milk Ca(tot) concentrations were also quantified. A transient postpartum decrease of serum Ca(tot) and Ca2+ concentrations was observed, whereas milk Ca(tot) concentration was constant. Plasma concentration of PTHrP was detected in 11 of 21 cows by use of an immunoradiometric assay (range, 0.45 to 1.82 pmol/L). Daily mean (+/- SD) colostrum and milk PTHrP concentrations ranged from 3.25 (+/- 3.23) to 4.69 (+/- 1.36) nmol/L in LP cows and 2.74 (+/- 0.5) to 5.95 (+/- 0.33) nmol/L in HP cows.

	abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has been shown to be present in milk of various mammals. We have assayed PTHrP in milk of various species by radioimmunoassay and estimated the molecular weights by Western blot analysis. PTHrP concentrations in bovine, ovine and human milk were 59.2 +/- 18.5, 74.1 +/- 35.0 and 36.6 +/- 20.7 micrograms/l (mean +/- S.D.) respectively, in pooled samples collected at various stages of lactation. PTHrP in mammalian milk was found to exist in two forms with molecular weights of 17.5 kDa and 21.5 kDa approximating those of PTHrP(1-108) and (1-141) respectively. In comparison, marsupial milk PTHrP appeared as a single low molecular weight form of 14.4 kDa which approximated to that of PTHrP(1-84). We performed a longitudinal study measuring the concentration of PTHrP in milk throughout lactation in cows, and found it to increase with the duration of lactation (r = 0.669, n = 91). We further examined the relationship between the concentration of PTHrP and total calcium in bovine milk, and the differences between these constituents in milk from Friesian and Jersey cows. PTHrP concentrations correlated positively with total milk calcium (r = 0.346, n = 105). The mean milk concentration of PTHrP of the Jerseys was significantly higher than that of the Friesians (52.6 +/- 5.4 micrograms/l compared with 41.0 +/- 4.8 micrograms/l, P less than 0.01), as was the mean milk calcium concentration (30.5 +/- 3.0 mmol/l compared with 26.7 +/- 2.7 mmol/l, P less than 0.01). We therefore postulate that production of PTHrP by the mammary gland may be associated with calcium transport from blood to milk. Also PTHrP may play a role in the development of milk fever in Jerseys which are predisposed to this condition.},

	abstract = {At the initiation of lactation, Ca homeostatic mechanisms have to react to a tremendous increase in demand for Ca. Mobilization of Ca from bone and increased absorption from the gastrointestinal tract are required to re-establish homeostasis. It has been shown that dietary anions play an important role in the prevention of milk fever by mobilizing Ca from bone and by increasing Ca absorption in the GI tract. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of different Ca contents in diets supplemented with anionic salts on bone metabolism of dairy cows. Twenty-four holstein cows (housed inside, second to fourth lactation) without a milk fever history were divided into four groups (A, B, C, D). Each group was fed a different diet which was given from day 263 of gestation till the day of parturition. Group A and B received a low calcium diet (4 g/kg DM) whereas group C and D received a high Ca diet (8 g/kg DM). In addition group B and D received anionic salts. The DCAD was calculated with the formula: DCAD (mEq/kg DM)=(0.2 Ca2++0.16 Mg2++Na++K+)-(Cl-+0.6 S2-+0.65 P3-). Blood and urine samples were collected on days 256, 270 and 277 of gestation, on the day of parturition as well as the following 5 days and on days 9, 14 and 19 after parturition. Serum Ca, P, Mg, ICTP, OC, VITD, PTH and urinary pH were analysed. The bone resorption marker ICTP showed a significant increase after parturition in all the groups. On the contrary, the bone formation marker OC decreased after parturition in all the groups. The VITD concentrations in group D and the urinary pH in group B were significantly lower compared to the other groups (p{\textless}0.05). The Ca concentrations tended to be higher in group B around parturition than in all the other groups. No significant influence of the four different diets on all the other parameters could be shown. In conclusion, this data showed that the addition of anions and the different Ca contents had no significant influence on bone resorption and bone formation markers. This may be because of the fact that the dietary cation-anion balance was not low enough (DCAD-group A: 181 mEq/kg DM, group B: -48 mEq/kg DM, group C: 210 mEq/kg DM and group D: 28 mEq/kg DM) to induce a metabolic acidosis with all its positive effects on calcium metabolism.},

The goal of the present study was to follow these changes in lactating cows and to investigate whether cows with a higher milk yield have a higher mobilization rate of calcium from bone. Hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, pyridinoline, and the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) were chosen as markers for bone resorption, whereas osteocalcin was used as a bone formation marker. Urine and blood samples were collected from cows with a mean standard milk yield of 4900 and 6500 kg, respectively, 14 d before, and 14 d, 1 mo, 1.5 mo, and monthly after parturition. Urinary hydroxyproline, deoxypyridinoline, and pyridinoline concentrations increased with time, but no differences between the two groups were evident. Concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and ICTP of the two groups showed an increase 14 d after parturition. Furthermore, using multivariate regression models with age and milk yield as covariates, ICTP concentrations were higher in the group with a higher milk yield. In contrast, osteocalcin concentrations decreased 14 d after parturition and returned to prepartum values 1 mo after parturition. The increase of ICTP concentrations in both groups indicates that bone was substantially resorbed. At the same time, probably less Ca was embedded in bone, as indicated by the decrease of the osteocalcin concentrations. In conclusion, cows showed increased bone resorption around parturition, and cows with higher milk yield mobilize calcium more actively from bone than cows with lower milk yield.},

Plasma PTHrP levels in both arterial and venous samples were below the detection limit (0.57 pmol/l) during the experimental period. Milk PTHrP and Ca levels were measured in 9 Holstein dairy cows. Although plasma PTHrP levels in all arterial and venous samples were also below the detection limit, milk PTHrP and Ca levels were remarkably high, ranging from 14,900 pmol/l to 41,200 pmol/l and from 772 mg/l to 1,200 mg/l, respectively. In addition, a significant positive correlation (P{\textless}0.01) was observed between milk PTHrP and Ca levels.

	abstract = {Eighteen multiparous Holstein cows were used to study the long term effect of reducing dietary P concentration on intake of DM and milk yield, on blood levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi), Ca, vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH) as well as assessing bone turnover by the use of bone formation marker osteocalcin (OC) and bone resorption marker cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX). Treatments were initiated 3 weeks before expected calving, and cows were followed until week 36 after calving. In dry period treatments were Low P (LP) (1.7 g P/kg of DM), Medium P (MP) (2.1 g P/kg DM) and High P (HP) (2.5 g P/kg DM). After parturition and throughout lactation treatments were LP (2.3 g P/kg DM), MP (2.8 g P/kg DM) and HP (3.4 g P/kg DM). Differences in dietary P were obtained by adding 0.60 and 1.19\% mono-sodium phosphate per kg DM to MP and HP, respectively. The cows were fed restrictively pre-partum and for ad libitum intake from one week before expected calving and throughout the experiment. Due to a high number of health problems, LP treatment was terminated after sampling in week 12, and cows were shifted to HP and continued on this treatment until week 36. Reduction in P concentration from 3.4 to 2.3 g P/kg DM reduced DMI, milk yield, milk protein yield and plasma Pi concentration, and increased serum concentration of CTX, but did not affect serum concentration of OC in early lactation. Reduced dietary P concentration from 3.4 to 2.8 g P/kg DM did not affect DMI or milk production in early lactation. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not affected by dietary P concentration in late lactation. Plasma Ca increased in LP, whereas there was no effect on serum concentration of PTH or on plasma concentration of vitamin D3 pre-partum, in early or late lactation. Despite an estimated mobilization of P in early lactation, on the basis of results of CTX and OC, it is not possible to reduce P concentration from 3.4 to 2.3 g P/kg DM in dairy cows in this period without compromising DMI and milk production. The results indicate a potential for reducing P concentration in early and late lactation from the current recommendations of 3.4 to 2.8 g P/kg DM without effects on performance, but this level of dietary P might not allow for repletion of bone P mobilized in early lactation.},

Further research is required before these lesions can be identified and new knowledge applied to the development of economical, effective programs that prevent milk fever and hypomagnesemic tetany.

	abstract = {The concentration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in the blood of healthy animals is extremely low. However, milk contains a relatively large amount of PTHrP, and the changes in its levels in the early stages of lactation in cows remain unclear. To understand the characteristics of parturient changes in milk PTHrP content and the biological implications thereof, changes in milk PTHrP concentrations were measured at 7 time intervals between parturition and 21 days postpartum in 8 primiparous and 8 multiparous Holstein cows. Based on these results, milk samples were collected from 47 primiparous and 66 multiparous Holstein cows at 3 days postpartum to investigate the relationship between milk PTHrP concentration and the variables of cow age, milk yield, and milk calcium concentration. Milk PTHrP concentration in both parity groups was found to be lowest on the day of parturition (primiparous, 3.1±0.5 nM and multiparous, 1.6±0.3 nM) but to significantly increase on day 14 of lactation in primiparous cows (6.2±0.8 nM) and day 7 of lactation in multiparous cows (4.1±0.2 nM). Comparison of the 2 groups revealed that milk PTHrP concentrations in primiparous cows were higher than those of multiparous cows in the first 3 days of lactation. Although a significant negative relationship was found between milk PTHrP concentration and both age (r=−0.65) and milk calcium concentration (r=−0.19) at 3 days postpartum, no significant correlation was found between milk PTHrP concentration and milk yield. The study thus identified 3 unique characteristics of milk PTHrP concentration in the early stages of lactation: milk PTHrP concentration is higher in primiparous than multiparous cows, milk PTHrP concentration is lower in colostrum than later milk, and the difference in milk PTHrP concentration between primiparous and multiparous cows at 3 days postpartum is more strongly influenced by age than milk yield.},

Cows were maintained in individual box stalls from 20 d before expected parturition and fed a common diet. Jugular blood samples were collected at -14, -13, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1 d before expected calving, at calving, and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 28, 56, and 84 d postcalving. After calving, cows were housed in 1 pen in a free-stall barn and consumed a common diet. Colorimetric assays were used to analyze Ca, P, and Mg concentrations in serum. Serum concentrations of osteocalcin (OC), an indicator of bone formation, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were determined in samples obtained from d -5 through d 13. The 9 control multiparous cows and 5 untreated primiparous cows were used to evaluate the effect of parity on the variables that were measured. There was no effect of parity on Ca, PTH, or 25-OH concentration. Compared with second-lactation cows and older cows ({\textgreater}2 lactations), first-lactation cows had greater serum OC (22.3, 32.0, and 48.3 ng/mL, respectively), indicating that younger animals were forming more bone. Blood Ca, P, and Mg decreased near the time of calving and then increased over time. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) was greater for cows dosed with 25-OH (119.0 ng/mL) compared with those dosed with D(3) (77.5 ng/mL) or CON (69.3 ng/mL). Cows dosed with 25-OH tended to have lower serum PTH concentration, but treatments did not affect serum Ca, P, or Mg. Serum OC was greater in second-lactation cows compared with cows entering their third or fourth lactation but OC was unaffected by treatment. Although results indicated a 60\% increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) due to a single oral dose of 25-OH before calving, the amount administered in this study apparently was not sufficient for initiation of any improvement in Ca homeostasis at parturition.},

Eighteen Holstein cows were blocked by parity and calving date and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: high (1.03\%, HI), medium (0.78\%, MED), or low (0.52\%, LOW) dietary Ca. Dietary P was 0.34\% in all diets. Cows consumed treatment diets from calving to 140 DIM. Total collection of milk, urine, and feces was conducted 2 wk before expected calving and in wk 2, 5, 8, 11, and 20 of lactation. Blood samples were collected at 14 and 10 d before expected calving and 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 140 d after calving. Blood samples were analyzed for Ca, P, and parathyroid hormone concentration. Serum concentrations of osteocalcin (OC), a marker of bone formation, and deoxypyridinoline (DPD), a marker of bone resorption, were measured to assess bone mobilization. Rib bone biopsies were conducted within 10 d postcalving and during wk 11 and 20 of lactation. Dietary Ca concentration affected Ca balance, with cows consuming the HI Ca diet in positive Ca balance for all weeks with the exception of wk 11. Interestingly, all cows across all treatments had a negative Ca balance at wk 11, possibly the result of timed estrous synchronization that occurred during wk 11. At wk 20, Ca balances were 61.2, 29.9, and 8.1 g/d for the HI, MED, and LOW diets, respectively. Phosphorus balances across all treatments and weeks were negative. Bone Ca content on a fat-free ash weight basis was least in cows consuming the MED diet, but bone P was not different. Serum Ca and P were not affected by treatment. Dietary Ca concentration did not affect P balance in the weeks examined, but there was a clear effect of parity on balance, markers of bone metabolism, and bone P. Primiparous cows had greater serum OC and DPD concentrations than multiparous cows. Regardless of dietary treatment, serum OC concentration peaked around d 35 of lactation. Simultaneously, DPD concentration began to decrease, which may indicate a switch from net bone resorption to formation after d 35. However, this was not reflected in balance measures. This information may help refine dietary mineral recommendations for lactating dairy cows and suggests that dietary P requirements are independent of dietary Ca.},

	abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related protein shares similarities in sequence and function with the endocrine hormone, parathyroid hormone. However, unlike parathyroid hormone, a product of the parathyroid glands, parathyroid hormone-related protein has a wide distribution in tissues, including the mammary gland. Although during pregnancy the expression of parathyroid hormone-related protein in the mammary gland is low, following birth, protein levels rise sharply in the gland in response to elevations in serum prolactin. Large amounts of parathyroid hormone-related protein are secreted into milk, suggesting a possible role in the neonate. Transient phosphaturia and elevations of parathyroid hormone-related protein in mammary vein plasma support a possible endocrine function for parathyroid hormone-related protein during lactation. Recent evidence suggests a local function for parathyroid hormone-related protein in the lactating mammary gland, and evidence exists that parathyroid hormone-related protein stimulates calcium secretion by the goat mammary gland. Parathyroid hormone-related protein, a putative vasodilator, is produced by the external nutrient vasculature of the mammary gland, and levels within this tissue are regulated during lactation. Infusion of parathyroid hormone-related protein into the ovine mammary artery increases gland blood flow, suggesting a role for the protein in modulation of mammary gland hemodynamics. Regulation of parathyroid hormone-related protein synthesis by the lactating gland, together with the protein's actions on regional blood flow and calcium secretion, support an important function in the mammary gland during lactogenesis.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of calcium are transferred to offspring by milk. This demand results in negative calcium balance in lactating mothers and is associated with rapid bone loss. The mechanisms of bone loss during lactation are only partly understood. Several studies have suggested that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) might be secreted into the circulation by the lactating mammary gland and regulate bone turnover during lactation. Because mammary development fails in the absence of PTHrP, conventional PTHrP knockout mice cannot be used to address this possibility. To examine this hypothesis, we therefore used mice carrying a beta-lactoglobulin promoter-driven Cre transgene, one null PTHrP allele, and one floxed PTHrP allele. Expression of Cre specifically in mammary epithelial cells during late pregnancy and lactation resulted in efficient deletion of the PTHrP gene; mammary gland PTHrP mRNA and milk PTHrP protein were almost completely absent. Removal of PTHrP from the lactating mammary glands resulted in reductions in levels of circulating PTHrP and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and urinary cAMP. In addition, bone turnover was reduced and bone loss during lactation was attenuated. We conclude that during lactation mammary epithelial cells are a source of circulating PTHrP that promotes bone loss by increasing rates of bone resorption.},

However, little is known about the regulation of PTHrP production or the physiological role(s) of PTHrP in the mammary glands. To address these questions, we examined in lactating rats 1) the longitudinal changes in PTHrP concentrations in milk and PTHrP mRNA levels in the mammary glands throughout lactation, 2) the effects of the nonsuckling interval on milk PTHrP concentration, and 3) the correlation between PTHrP and calcium concentrations in milk. PTHrP concentrations in milk, measured by RIA and in vitro bioassay, increased with the duration of lactation. The maximal concentrations of PTHrP (observed between days 19-21 of lactation in rats milked serially) were 4.8- to 8.0-fold higher than the concentrations on day 7. PTHrP mRNA levels in the mammary glands also increased during the late stages of lactation. The longitudinal changes in calcium concentrations in milk were small and did not parallel the changes in PTHrP. When pups were removed from the mother for 4-24 h, milk PTHrP decreased while calcium increased in a time-dependent manner. As a whole, calcium concentrations in milk did not correlate with PTHrP throughout lactation. These data suggest that the production and secretion of PTHrP into milk are regulated independently of the other major milk proteins by a factor(s) that changes with progression of lactation and in relation to suckling status.},

	abstract = {Calcium is absorbed in the mammalian small intestine by two general mechanisms: a transcellular active transport process, located largely in the duodenum and upper jejunum; and a paracellular, passive process that functions throughout the length of the intestine. The transcellular process involves three major steps: entry across the brush border, mediated by a molecular structure termed CaT1, intracellular diffusion, mediated largely by the cytosolic calcium-binding protein (calbindinD(9k) or CaBP); and extrusion, mediated largely by the CaATPase. Chyme travels down the intestinal lumen in approximately 3 h, spending only minutes in the duodenum, but over 2 h in the distal half of the small intestine. When calcium intake is low, transcellular calcium transport accounts for a substantial fraction of the absorbed calcium. When calcium intake is high, transcellular transport accounts for only a minor portion of the absorbed calcium, because of the short sojourn time and because CaT1 and CaBP, both rate-limiting, are downregulated when calcium intake is high. Biosynthesis of CaBP is fully and CaT1 function is approximately 90\% vitamin D-dependent. At high calcium intakes CaT1 and CaBP are downregulated because 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), the active vitamin D metabolite, is downregulated.},

	volume = {50},
	issn = {0007-1145},
	abstract = {Mineral balance and radioisotope studies have been carried out to test the adequacy of the recent Agricultural Research Council (1980) recommendations for calcium and phosphorus for pregnant and lactating ewes. At the same time, P metabolism was compared throughout pregnancy and lactation in ewes fed according to these recommendations and in ewes fed a plentiful supply of dietary Ca and P. Bone mineral stores were mobilized in late pregnancy and early lactation, irrespective of the rate of P absorption. These stores were then replaced in mid- to late lactation in ewes given the plentiful Ca and P intake but not in the ewes given the restricted intake. Results suggest that these changes in bone stores occurred as a result of changes in Ca requirements rather than in P requirements, and that accretion of P into bone or resorption of P from bone occurred merely as a consequence of this change in Ca requirements. Immediate demands for P for maintenance and fetal or milk production do not reflect net P demands, which also take into account changes in bone P metabolism. The rate of P absorption was directly related to net demands and the rate of endogenous excretion was inversely related to net demands. Absorption and endogenous faecal loss of P were also both directly related to P intake. A lack of dietary Ca, particularly in mid- to late lactation, makes it impossible to draw conclusions on the adequacy of the Agricultural Research Council (1980) recommendations for P. Results do suggest, however, that P requirements ought to be calculated according to net demands for P rather than immediate demands.},

	abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP) has been quantified by sensitive specific immunoassays in mammary venous blood and milk from 7 days before to 7 days after parturition in the goat. A significant venous-arterial concentration gradient in plasma PTHRP 1-86 concentrations was demonstrated across the mammary gland, indicating that PTHRP enters the maternal circulation and may have a role in calcium homoeostasis during lactation. Significant and sustained increases in mammary venous and milk PTHRP 1-86 concentrations were found from 1 day before parturition to 7 days afterwards, with peak concentrations of 1.57 +/- 0.58 pmol/l (plasma) and 8.69 +/- 2.95 nmol/l (milk) (mean +/- S.E.M.) occurring on day -1 and the day of parturition respectively. Estimates of the mammary output of PTHRP into plasma in four goats averaged 9\% (range 1-25\%) of that secreted into milk. Suppression of maternal prolactin concentrations by bromocriptine significantly reduced milk yield and the mammary venous PTHRP concentration, without affecting the concentration of PTHRP in milk. In conclusion, parturition in the goat is associated with a sustained increase in secretion of PTHRP into both plasma and milk; the former may be involved in maternal calcium homoeostasis, whereas the latter may have a role in the neonate.},

In the present work, we have studied the possible role of synthetic human PTHrP(1-34), (1-86) and (140-173) fragments on calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium secretion into milk of four adult goats in early lactation. This was done by measuring differences in calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium concentrations in the carotid artery and superficial epigastric vein, the concentration of these minerals in milk and milk production. Both PTHrP(1-34) and (1-86) fragments stimulated calcium, inorganic phosphorus and magnesium uptake by the mammary gland and secretion into milk, without any significant effect on milk production. Therefore PTHrP might have important physiological roles in the pregnant and/or lactating female, by regulating calcium transport through the placenta and mammary gland.},

Each peptide (6 nmol/fetus per day) was injected i.v. three times per day from day 105 until day 116 of gestation. Placental Ca transfer (mmol/24 h per kg fetal wt) from the dam to the fetus was not different in control fetuses 7·1±0·6) and those given PTHrp(107–138) (7·2±0·5), but it was significantly increased by bovine PTH(1–34) (8·6±0·4; P {\textless} 0·05) and by PTHrp(1–34) (10·1±0·3; P {\textless} 0·01). Both peptides also significantly increased plasma concentrations of 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D). These results indicate that PTHrp(1–34) can stimulate placental Ca transfer by increasing 1,25-(OH)2D synthesis, but also possibly by acting directly upon the placenta.

TERNOUTH* The reasons for the reduction in food intake due to low P diets are not fully understood because of other interrelated factors such as Ca:P ratio, degree of deficiency and physiological state of the animal. This study was conducted to investigate the response of lambs fed high and low levels of Ca and P in the diet (and to induce P deficiency in lambs for subsequent studies), Twelve 6-month-old Corriedale wether lambs (21.1-31.6 kg) were fed 4 diets containing high (H) and low (L) concentrations of Ca and P, in metabolism crates for 120 days. A basal diet composed of 60\% barley straw, 31\% refined sugar, 6.4\% gluten, 1.7\% urea and 0.9\% mineral-vitamin supplement and estimated to contain 9.92 MJ ME, 130 g crude protein, 1.35 g Ca and 0.72 g P/kgDM was fed to animals on low Ca and P diets. For high concentration diets, the levels of Ca and P were increased to 8.2 and 4.5 g/kgDM,respectively. Live weight,food intake,dry matter digestibility (DMD), apparent P absorption and plasma Ca and P were measured. TABLE 1 Response of sheep fed high and low concentrations of Ca and P?  The basal diet was initially consumed by all sheep but by the fourth week, the intake of the LP lambs had decreased so that over the whole experiment there were marked differences in intake (Table 1), which were reflected in the liveweight change. The difference in liveweight change between the HCaLP and LCaLP diets was significant ({\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}0.05). Plasma P levels were related to the concentration in the diet but plasma Ca levels were only reduced for LCaHP diet. DMD was reduced in HCaLP diet. Apparent P absorption was negative for LP diets. With HP diets,lambs on LCa diets had higher apparent P absorption over those on HCa diets. The results support the observation of Field et al. (1975) that low P diets cause significant reductions in food intake, the effect being due to the depletion of P reserves of the animal rather than the dietary levels per se. The low P diets used in this experiment resulted in negative P absorption. The lower DMD of the LP diets agree with earlier results obtained in our laboratory (Milton and Temouth 1979).

Twelve multiparous Holstein cows and twelve multiparous Jersey cows were intravenously infused daily for approximately 7 days prepartum with either saline or 1.0mg/kg bodyweight of the immediate precursor to serotonin synthesis, 5hydroxy-l-tryptophan (5-HTP). On infusion days, blood was collected before, after, and at 2, 4, and 8h postinfusion. Blood and urine were collected daily before the infusion period, for 14 days postpartum and on day 30 postpartum. Milk was collected daily during the postpartum period. Feed intake and milk yield were unaffected by 5-HTP infusion postpartum. Cows infused with 5-HTP had elevated circulating serotonin concentrations prepartum. Infusion with 5-HTP induced a transient hypocalcemia in Jersey cows prepartum, but not in any other treatment. Holstein cows infused with saline had the highest milk calcium on the day of and day after parturition. Postpartum, circulating total calcium tended to be elevated, and urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) concentrations were elevated in Holstein cows infused with 5-HTP. Overall, Jerseys had higher urine DPD concentrations postpartum when compared with Holsteins. Taken together, these data warrant further investigation of the potential therapeutic benefit of 5-HTP administration prepartum for prevention of hypocalcemia. Further research should focus on delineation of mechanisms associated with 5-HTP infusion that control calcium homeostasis during the peripartum period in Holstein and Jersey cows.},

	abstract = {The mammary gland has a remarkable capacity for regulation at a local level, particularly with respect to its main function: milk secretion. Regulation of milk synthesis has significant effects on animal and human health, at the level of both the mother and the neonate. Control by the mammary gland of its essential function, milk synthesis, is an evolutionary necessity and is therefore tightly regulated at a local level. For at least the last 60 yr, researchers have been interested in elucidating the mechanisms underpinning the mammary gland’s ability to self-regulate, largely without the influence from systemic hormones or signals. By the 1960s, scientists realized the importance of milk removal in the capacity of the gland to produce milk and that the dynamics of this removal, including emptying of the alveolar spaces and frequency of milking, were controlled locally as opposed to traditional systemic hormonal regulation. Using both in vitro systems and various mammalian species, including goats, marsupials, humans, and dairy cows, it has been demonstrated that the mammary gland is largely self-regulating in its capacity to support the young, which is the evolutionary basis for milk production. Local control occurs at the level of the mammary epithelial cell through pressure and stretching negative-feedback mechanisms, and also in an autocrine fashion through bioactive factors within the milk which act as inhibitors, regulating milk secretion within the alveoli themselves. It is only within the last 20 to 30 yr that potential candidates for these bioactive factors have been examined at a molecular level. Several, including parathyroid hormone-related protein, growth factors (transforming growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, epidermal growth factor), and serotonin, are synthesized within and act upon the gland and possess dynamic receptor activity resulting in diverse effects on growth, calcium homeostasis, and milk composition. This review will focus on the autocrine-paracrine regulation of the mammary gland, with an examination of both foundational work and the progress made within the last 10 to 20 yr of research.},

	abstract = {The transition from pregnancy to lactation puts significant, sudden demands on maternal energy and calcium reserves. Although most mammals are able to effectively manage these metabolic adaptations, the lactating dairy cow is acutely susceptible to transition-related disorders because of the high amounts of milk being produced. Hypocalcemia is a common metabolic disorder that occurs at the onset of lactation. Hypocalcemia is also known to result in poor animal welfare conditions. In addition, cows that develop hypocalcemia are more susceptible to a host of other negative health outcomes. Different feeding tactics, including manipulating the dietary cation-anion difference and administering low-calcium diets, are commonly used preventative strategies. Despite these interventions, the incidence of hypocalcemia in the subclinical form is still as high as 25\% to 30\% in the United States dairy cow population, with a 5\% to 10\% incidence of clinical hypocalcemia. In addition, although there are various effective treatments in place, they are administered only after the cow has become noticeably ill, at which point there is already significant metabolic damage. This emphasizes the need for developing alternative prevention strategies, with the monoamine serotonin implicated as a potential therapeutic target. Our research in rodents has shown that serotonin is critical for the induction of mammary parathyroid hormone–related protein, which is necessary for the mobilization of bone tissue and subsequent restoration of maternal calcium stores during lactation. We have shown that circulating serotonin concentrations are positively correlated with serum total calcium on the first day of lactation in dairy cattle. Administration of serotonin's immediate precursor through feeding, injection, or infusion to various mammalian species has been shown to increase circulating serotonin concentrations, with positive effects on other components of maternal metabolism. Most recently, preliminary data suggest that manipulation of the serotonergic axis precalving may positively affect postcalving calcium dynamics. Combined, our research suggests a potential mechanism by which serotonin acts on the mammary gland to maintain circulating maternal calcium concentrations. Further research into serotonin's potential as a therapeutic target could contribute significantly as a preventive strategy against hypocalcemia in early lactation dairy cows.},

The aim of this study was to quantify the genetic variation in levels of Se, Ca, K, Zn, Mg, and P in milk and to quantify the between-herd variation in the levels of these minerals in milk. One morning milk sample from each of 1,860 Dutch Holstein-Friesian cows from 388 commercial herds in the Netherlands was used. Concentration of minerals was determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Variance components were estimated using an animal model with covariates for days in milk and age at first calving; fixed effects for season of calving and effect of test or proven bull; and random effects for animal, herd, and error. Heritability and proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by herd were estimated using univariate analysis. The intraherd heritability for Se was low (0.20) whereas herd explained 65\% of the total variation in Se. Variation between herds most likely results from variation in Se content in the feed, which partly reflects variation in Se levels in the soil. Intraherd heritabilities for Ca, K, Zn, Mg, and P were moderate to high and were 0.57, 0.46, 0.41, 0.60, and 0.62, respectively. For Ca, K, Zn, Mg, and P, the proportions of phenotypic variation that could be explained by herd were low (0.13-0.24). This study shows that there are possibilities for altering the mineral composition of milk. For Ca, K, Zn, Mg, and P, there are good prospects for selective breeding whereas, for Se, measures at farm level may be more effective.},

	abstract = {The transfer of calcium from mother to milk during lactation is poorly understood. In this report, we demonstrate that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) production and calcium transport in mammary epithelial cells are regulated by extracellular calcium acting through the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). The CaR becomes expressed on mammary epithelial cells at the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Increasing concentrations of calcium, neomycin, and a calcimimetic compound suppress PTHrP secretion by mammary epithelial cells in vitro, whereas in vivo, systemic hypocalcemia increases PTHrP production, an effect that can be prevented by treatment with a calcimimetic. Hypocalcemia also reduces overall milk production and calcium content, while increasing milk osmolality and protein concentrations. The changes in milk calcium content, milk osmolality, and milk protein concentration were mitigated by calcimimetic infusions. Finally, in a three-dimensional culture system that recapitulates the lactating alveolus, activation of the basolateral CaR increases transcellular calcium transport independent of its effect on PTHrP. We conclude that the lactating mammary gland can sense calcium and adjusts its secretion of calcium, PTHrP, and perhaps water in response to changes in extracellular calcium concentration. We believe this defines a homeostatic system that helps to match milk production to the availability of calcium.},

	abstract = {Milk and dairy products are a major source of minerals, particularly calcium, involved in several metabolic functions in humans. Currently, several dairy products are enriched with calcium to prevent osteoporosis. The development of an inexpensive and fast quantitative analysis for minerals is required to offer dairy farmers an opportunity to improve the added value of the produced milk. The aim of this study was to develop 5 equations to measure Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P contents directly in bovine milk using mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry. A total of 1,543 milk samples were collected between March 2005 and May 2006 from 478 cows during the Walloon milk recording and analyzed by MIR spectrometry. Using a principal component approach, 62 milk samples were selected by their spectral variability and separated in 2 calibration sets. Five outliers were detected and deleted. The mineral contents of the selected samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Using partial least squares combined with a repeatability file, 5 calibration equations were built to estimate the contents of Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P in milk. To assess the accuracy of the developed equations, a full cross-validation and an external validation were performed. The cross-validation coefficients of determination (R(2)cv) were 0.80, 0.70, and 0.79 for Ca, Na, and P, respectively (n = 57), and 0.23 and 0.50 for K and Mg, respectively (n = 31). Only Ca, Na, and P equations showed sufficient R(2)cv for a potential application. These equations were validated using 30 new milk samples. The validation coefficients of determination were 0.97, 0.14, and 0.88 for Ca, Na, and P, respectively, suggesting the potential to use the Ca and P calibration equations. The last 30 samples were added to the initial milk samples and the calibration equations were rebuilt. The R(2)cv for Ca, K, Mg, Na, and P were 0.87, 0.36, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.85, respectively, confirming the potential utilization of the Ca and P equations. Even if new samples should be added in the calibration set, the first results of this study showed the feasibility to quantify the calcium and phosphorus directly in bovine milk using MIR spectrometry.},

A preliminary chemometric study with the use of pattern recognition methods was carried out in order to characterise, classify and distinguish the different collected samples on the basis of their contents. Principal component analysis (PCA) has permitted the reduction of 16 variables to five principal components which interpret reasonably well the correlations of these studied variables. These variable associations may be attributed to intrinsic (lactogenesis) and other extrinsic factors, such as seasonal variation, animal feeding or geographical situation. Changes in these contents during different seasons were also assessed and consistently interpreted. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to explore cow milk samples, classifying according to season or geographical location, providing complementary information to PCA. This work shows that PCA and LDA are useful chemometric tools for the multivariate characterisation of raw cows' milk. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Twenty multiparous Holstein dairy cows were randomized into two groups. Cows of group 1 (n = 10) were partially milked at the first and second milking postpartum. Cows of group 2 (n = 10) were completely milked. Blood samples were collected from all animals 5-7 days before calving, within 30 min after calving, and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 h after calving for determination of serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations.

Serum Ca and P concentrations decreased in both groups after parturition (P {\textless} 0.05) and remained low during 32 h postpartum with no difference observed between groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Serum concentrations of Mg were stable in all samples and no statistical difference was observed between groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

Colostrum Ca secretion increased at the second milking with respect to the first one in both groups (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no correlation between serum Ca and colostrum Ca (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

	abstract = {A dynamic, stochastic, and mechanistic Monte Carlo model, simulating a dairy herd with focus on the feeding-health-production complex is presented. By specifying biological parameters at cow level and a management strategy at herd level, the model can simulate the technical and economic consequences of scenarios at herd level. The representation of the feeding-health-production complex is aimed to be sufficiently detailed, to include relationships likely to cause significant herd effects, and to be sufficiently simple to enable a feasible parameterization of the model and interpretation of the results from the model. Consequently, diseases are defined as four disease types: two metabolic disease types, an udder disease type, and a reproductive disease type. Risk factors for the diseases were defined as parity, yield capacity, disease recurrence, disease interrelationships, lactation stage, and season. Direct effects of the diseases were defined according to milk yield, feed intake, feed utilization, conception, culling, involuntary removal, and death. Scenarios differing in base risks of milk fever and ketosis, heat detection rate, and culling strategy were simulated for describing the model behavior. Annual milk yield per cow was decreased by increased risk of ketosis and by increased risk of milk fever, even though no direct effect of milk fever on milk yield was modeled at the cow level. The indirect effect from milk fever is a consequence of increased replacement rate (relatively lower milk yield from younger cows). By ignoring the history of milk fever in insemination and replacement decisions, a significantly reduced net income per cow was found in some herds. We concluded that important benefits from using such a herd model are the capability of accounting for herd management factors and the advantage of avoiding to double count the indirect effects from disease, such as increased risk of other diseases, poorer reproduction results, and increased risk of culling and death.},

Results showed lower mineral contents for milk from the organic dairy compared with milk from the conventional dairies. For all minerals, there was a significant effect of season, whereas the riboflavin content varied only significantly across the year in milk from the organic dairy, resulting in lower levels during summer and higher levels during the indoor winter period. Despite this variation, milk from the organic dairy generally contained more riboflavin than milk from the two conventional dairies.},

Despite the increasing number of studies, the causes for abnormal coagulation of milk are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to ascertain relationships between milk characteristics and its rennet coagulation ability, focusing on the influence of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P). Ca and P are essential constituents of the micelles. Micellar P can be present as part of colloidal calcium phosphate (inorganic-P) or covalently bound to caseins as phosphate groups (casein-P). Eighty one herd milk samples (SCC{\textless}400 000 cell/ml) were classified as Optimal (8), Suboptimal (39) Poor (29) and Non-coagulating milk (5), according to their rennet coagulation parameters as assessed by lactodynamographic test. Samples were analysed for their chemical composition (basic composition, protein fractions, minerals and salt equilibria), physicochemical parameters (pH and titratable acidity) and rheological properties. Optimal milk was characterised by the highest contents of major constituents, protein fractions and minerals, lowest content of chloride and highest values of titratable acidity. Non-coagulating milk was characterised by the highest values of pH and the lowest of titratable acidity. At micellar level, Optimal milk showed the highest values of colloidal Ca, casein-P and colloidal Mg (g/100 g casein), while Non-coagulating milk showed the lowest values. Interestingly, there was no statistical difference regarding the content of colloidal inorganic-P (g/100 g casein) between Optimal and Non-coagulating milks. Overall, high mineralisation of the micelle (expressed as g inorganic-P/100 g casein) positively affect its rennetability. However, excessive mineralisation could lead to a reduction of the phosphate groups (g casein-P/100 g casein) available for curd formation.},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN14479},
	abstract = {Marked improvements in milk production, health and reproduction have resulted from manipulations of the pre-calving diet. An understanding of the underlying physiological changes resulting from manipulation of late gestational diets is needed in order to refine and enhance these responses. The physiology of late gestation and early lactation of the dairy cow is examined in the context of exploring the hypothesis that changes in physiology occur not only through homeostatic, but also homeorhetic change. Studies in mice and man have identified a pivotal role for skeleton, particularly through production of active forms of osteocalcin, in integrating energy metabolism. Skeleton appears to particularly influence lipid metabolism and vice versa. Further insights into the factors influencing skeletal function and calcium (Ca) metabolism are emerging, including the potential for negative dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) diets to upregulate the responses of the skeleton in metabolism through increased bone mobilisation and in enhancing responses to parathyroid hormone. The rumen appears to be an important site of absorption of Ca, but physiological mechanisms influencing this uptake are not clear. We provide quantitative evidence of the magnitude of responses that reflect relationships linking Ca metabolism, skeleton and production, using meta-analytic methods. Negative DCAD diets increase milk production in multiparous cattle, but not in heifers. Further, examination of concentrations of metabolites related to energy metabolism obtained from cattle exposed to a negative DCAD diet over calving identified a dominant role for Ca concentrations, which were associated with blood-free fatty acids (NEFA), blood 3-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and cholesterol. These relationships were homeostatic, occurring on the same day, but also homeorhetic with concentrations of Ca and NEFA being significantly associated over 21 days. The findings in cattle are consistent with those in the murine models. However, Ca and the skeleton are not the only significant factors in the transition period influencing future performance as hormonal treatments, metabolic demands and sex of the conceptus, and inflammation and the factors controlling this play a role in future performance. Homeorhetic, longer-term, adaptive responses are critical to achieving orchestrated longer-term adaptive responses to calving and lactation. We consider that the teleological question ‘why would a bone-specific hormone (osteocalcin) regulate energy metabolism?’ is answered by the specific needs for integrated metabolism to address the extreme metabolic demands of lactation in many species.},

The objectives of this work were (1) to characterize milk from feeding systems based on herbage or corn silage with or without flaxseed and (2) to authenticate the milk from the three systems on the basis of the fatty acid (FA) profile. Bulk milk samples were collected five times on 24 farms in the West of France. Farms were classified according to three feeding systems: "Herbage" system with herbage as the only forage source; "Corn silage" system with corn silage as the main forage (33.6\% of DM grass based); "Corn silage+flaxseed" system with corn silage as the main forage (24\% of DM grass based) supplemented with 690 g.day−1.cow−1 of extruded flaxseed. The "Corn silage+flaxseed" system had higher milk yield and lower milk fat and protein contents. Compared to milk from “Herbage system”, milk from "Corn silage+flaxseed" system was rich in mono- and poly-unsaturated FAs, trans FAs, C18:0, isomers of C18:1 and C18:2 (respectively +13, +21, +28, +13, +44, +54 percentage units), whereas milk from the "Herbage" system was rich in odd, branched chain FAs and cis-9,trans-11-CLA (respectively +51, +55 and +15 percentage units compared to milk from "Corn silage+flaxseed" system). Milk FA composition from "Herbage" and "Corn silage" systems was more variable throughout the year than that from the "Corn silage+flaxseed" system because of the incorporation of more pasture during spring and summer. The linear discriminant analysis performed on FAs permitted to differentiate milk from each system with only 2.5\% of milks misclassified, even for milk from the "Herbage" and "Corn silage+flaxseed" systems, which had a similar C18:3 content. This study showed that it is possible to characterize milk from different feeding systems and especially to differentiate one from another based on their composition of some milk FAs.},

In both the physiological and pathological circumstances, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) plays a central role. Until recently there were no regulatory mechanisms to explain the induction of endocrine PTHrP secretion from breast cells during lactation. The mammary epithelium possesses a local serotonin signaling system which drives PTHrP expression during lactation and in breast cancer cells. The mammary gland serotonin system is highly induced in response to alveolar dilation due to milk secretion. Discovery of serotonergic control of PTHrP suggests that it may be possible to manipulate the breast-to-bone axis by targeting serotonin signaling.},

A shared mechanism among these physiological and pathological states is endocrine secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which acts through osteoblasts to stimulate osteoclastic bone demineralization. The regulation of PTHrP has not been accounted for fully by any conventional mammotropic stimuli or tumor growth factors. Serotonin (5-HT) synthesis within breast epithelial cells is induced during lactation and in advancing breast cancer. Here we report that serotonin deficiency (knockout of tryptophan hydroxylase-1) results in a reduction of mammary PTHrP expression during lactation, which is rescued by restoring 5-HT synthesis. 5-HT induced PTHrP expression in lactogen-primed mammary epithelial cells from either mouse or cow. In human breast cancer cells 5-HT induced both PTHrP and the metastasis-associated transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1. Based on receptor expression and pharmacological evidence, the 5-HT2 receptor type was implicated as being critical for induction of PTHrP and Runx2. These results connect 5-HT synthesis to the induction of bone-regulating factors in the normal mammary gland and in breast cancer cells.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate genetic progress in relation to milk composition, processability, and yield as a correlated response to selection for the Swedish breeding objective. Dairy cows with high genetic merit, classified as elite dairy cows, of the Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein breeds were used. Milk samples were collected on the farm level in winter and summer from a research herd at Nötcenter Viken, a bovine research farm in Sweden. Comparisons were made with milk from a Swedish Red herd, a Swedish Holstein herd, and a Swedish dairy processor in the same geographical area. Protein, lipid, and carbohydrate profiles as well as minerals were analyzed, and technological properties, including rennet-induced gelation characteristics, lipid oxidation, total antioxidant capacity, and fat globule size, were determined. Higher yields were found for elite cows for components of the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate profiles as well as for minerals, implying genetic progress in relation to milk yield; however, the content of some milk components (e.g., lipid and whey protein contents) had decreased on average. Milk from the elite cows had good gelation characteristics, but was more susceptible to lipid autooxidation and had a lower total antioxidant capacity. These results demonstrate that milk composition and processing characteristics could be used to adjust breeding practices to optimize the quality and stability of milk and dairy products.},

The application of physical chemical techniques such as light, neutron, and X-ray scattering and electron microscopy has yielded a wealth of experimental detail concerning the structure of the casein micelle. From these experimental data bases have arisen two conflicting models for the internal structure of the casein micelle. One model emphasizes protein submicellar structures as the dominant feature, while the other proposes that inorganic calcium phosphate nanoclusters serve this function. These models are critically examined in light of our current information regarding the biological processes of protein secretion. In addition two primary tenets of structural biology are applied: that protein structure gives rise to function and that competent protein–protein interactions (associations) will lead to efficient transit through the mammary secretory apparatus. However, a set of complex equilibria governs this process which may be completed only after the final step in the processes: milking. In this light an overwhelming argument can be made for the formation of proteinacious complexes (submicelles) as the formative agents in the synthesis of casein micelles in mammary tissue. Whether these submicelles persist in the milk has been questioned. However, perturbations in micellar equilibria allow for the reemergence of submicellar particles in dairy products such as cheese. Thus protein–protein interactions appear to be important in milk and dairy products from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cheese cutting board.},

	abstract = {Milk and dairy products are an important source of Ca for humans. Recent studies have shown fluctuations in cow milk Ca content during the year in France, with high values in winter and with corn silage diets, and a decrease during May and June and with grass diets. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for this seasonal decrease in milk Ca content by testing the effect of 2 levels of dietary cation-anion differences (DCAD; 0 mEq/kg of dry matter for DCAD 0 and 400 mEq/kg for DCAD 400) and 2 day lengths (8 h of light/d for short days: SD; and 16 h/d for long days: LD) on the Ca balances of dairy cows. The DCAD treatments were designed to mimic diets based either on corn silage or on herbage. The cows were only illuminated by solarium lights providing UVA and UVB. The trial was conducted according to 2 simultaneous replicates of a 4×4 Latin square design using 8 dairy cows averaging 103±44 d in milk with 4 periods of 14 d. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with a model including treatment, cow, and period effects. No significant interaction was found between day length and DCAD treatments. With DCAD 400 compared with DCAD 0, blood pH increased and plasma ionized Ca content decreased, whereas the plasma total Ca content did not differ between treatments. Milk Ca content, however, increased with DCAD 400 compared with DCAD 0, in relation to a decrease in the amount of Ca excreted in urine. The DCAD had no significant effect on protein and casein contents and DCAD 400 tended to decrease milk yield. This illustrates that the udder did not decrease Ca uptake from the blood at high DCAD even though DCAD 400 decreased the mammary availability of Ca by decreasing the proportion of blood ionized Ca. Milk Ca and casein contents were significantly lower with LD compared with SD, whereas day length had no effect on milk yield after 14 d of treatment. Bone accretion of cows increased when the Ca content of milk increased (i.e., with DCAD 400 compared with DCAD 0 and with SD compared with LD). This work suggests that long and sunny days could explain part of the seasonal decrease in milk Ca content in summer and refutes the hypothesis that low milk Ca contents at grazing could be due to the high DCAD of herbage.},

Plasma inorganic P concentration is currently the best diagnostic marker of dietary P deficiency in growing cattle but is not suitable for assessing the P status of breeder cows, which often mobilise substantial bone and soft tissue reserves in late pregnancy and lactation. Markers of bone turnover offer potential as markers of P status in cattle, as they reflect bone mobilisation or bone formation. Recent experiments investigating the physiology of beef breeder cows during diet P deficiency have indicated that the ratio of plasma total calcium concentration to plasma inorganic P concentration might be suitable as a simple index of P deficiency. However, a more specific measure of increased bone mobilisation in P-deficient breeders is plasma concentration of C-terminal telopeptide of Type 1 collagen. Also, plasma concentration of bone alkaline phosphatase is a marker of defective bone mineralisation in dietary P deficiency. These candidate markers warrant further investigation to determine their predictive value for P deficiency in cattle.},

An extant whole-animal model was evaluated using an experiment conducted in Ontario to assess its applicability for predicting P excretion. The objective of the study was to use the model to estimate P excretion levels and the economic and environmental implications of implementing mitigating options by following recommendations from studies that have reported sufficient levels of P inclusion in the diet. Mean square prediction error and concordance coefficient analysis showed that the overall predictions were close to the mean and that there was only a slight underprediction of fecal P output by the model. The majority of the error was random, with only 8.9\% coming from error caused by deviation from the regression line, and the model did not show a systematic trend of over- or underprediction. The model was then used to predict P excretion in Ontario by using diets commonly fed to dairy cows on Ontario farms. It is estimated that Ontario dairy farms produce 7 kt of P annually at current levels of P inclusion in the diet. Reducing P levels from the current 0.41\% P of dry matter to 0.35\% is estimated to save producers CAN \$20/cow per year and the environment 1.3 kt/yr without impairing cow health or productivity. Additionally, the reductions might be from inorganic P sources added to the feed, which are more polluting than organic sources because of their water-soluble nature and liability to leaching and runoff.},

	abstract = {The objective was to develop stochastic models to estimate the economic impact in the first 30 d in milk of oral calcium supplementation to multiparous postparturient dairy cows using 4 different strategies: (1) supplementation of cows with a high previous lactation mature-equivalent milk yield, (2) supplementation of lame cows, (3) supplementation of both cows that have a high previous lactation mature-equivalent milk yield and cows that are lame, and (4) supplementation of all cows. Data from current literature were used to model input variables associated with the costs and risks related to milk production, postparturient disease, and culling. The mean net herd impact per 1,000 calvings for each of the 4 supplementation strategies was \$4,425, \$5,812, \$8,313, and \$3,065, respectively. Postpartum supplementation of multiparous lame cows had the highest return on investment at 6.5 to 1, followed by supplementation of multiparous high milk yield and lame cows, multiparous high milk yield cows only, and supplementation of all multiparous postpartum cows with returns of 1.8 to 1, 1.1 to 1, and 0.3 to 1, respectively. A herd’s average milk yield at first test had the highest influence on the net impact of oral calcium supplementation to all multiparous cows and accounted for 30\% of the variation, followed by the decrease in risk of health events in lame cows given oral calcium at 22\%, a herd’s prevalence of lameness at calving at 13\%, and the price of milk at 10\%. Each of the remaining stochastic variables contributed to less than 5\% of the variation in net herd financial impact of oral calcium administration. Whereas supplementation of all postpartum multiparous cows returned a positive net herd impact approximately 80\% of the time, if a herd was willing to devote time to mature-equivalent milk yield calculations and locomotion scoring, supplementation of this subpopulation of postpartum cows with oral calcium was estimated to have a positive economic impact in all iterations. Depending on the supplementation strategy chosen and baseline milk yield and immediate postpartum lameness prevalence in a herd, a herd with 1,000 calvings per year can expect to see an average net impact ranging from approximately \$3,000 to \$8,000 after postpartum supplementation of oral calcium in multiparous animals.},

Although these techniques provide increased sensitivity as compared with radiography, they still are limited by the fact that they can only document the net results of past skeletal activity. In contrast, serum and urinary biomarkers of bone formation and resorption provide near real-time information about bone cell activity. In this review, I describe the scientific rationale behind the use of these markers in humans and detail the efforts that have been made to adapt this technology to veterinary medicine and animal research. Commercial assay kits that are applicable to different animal species are described, and the potential limitations of the technology are discussed. The goal of this review is to provide clinical pathologists and researchers with the information needed to decide whether the use of bone markers is likely to be helpful and to select the most appropriate marker (or panel of markers) to answer a particular question.},

Après un chapitre consacré à place des éléments minéraux dans l'optimisation des fermentations dans le rumen, cet ouvrage s'attache à décrire le rôle joué dans l'organisme par chacun des éléments d'intérêt nutritionnel - macro- et oligoéléments -, mais aussi les conséquences de leur carence ou de leur excès, et indique les apports journaliers recommandés et ceux assurés par les principales catégories d'aliments. Les éléments " nouveaux ", potentiellement indispensables ou toxiques, sont ensuite abordés. Enfin, un dernier chapitre fait état des connaissances pratiques actuelles sur la stratégie de complémentation minérale des rations ; y sont également évoquées la valeur nutritionnelle des sources minérales d'apport supplémentaire et les modalités de leur distribution. Cet ouvrage a pour ambition de mettre à la disposition des professionnels de l'élevage, mais aussi des enseignants et des étudiants des filières agronomique et vétérinaire, une information rationnelle réunie dans un seul volume et faisant appel à de nombreuses références bibliographiques ; il vient compléter les récents traités de l'Inra sur la nutrition des ruminants domestiques.},

Serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen were also analyzed to study the effect of parturition on type III collagen, which is a component of soft connective tissues. Urine and blood samples were collected on d 1 to 5, on d 9, and d 14 after parturition from 18 cows with symptoms of periparturient paresis (group 1) and 19 healthy control cows without symptoms (group 2). Urine concentrations of hydroxyproline and deoxypyridinoline were measured with a colorimetric assay and an enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen were measured using a commercially available radioimmunoassay. A radioimmunoassay was developed to analyze serum concentrations of the carboxyterminal telopeptide of bovine type I collagen. The mean corrected urinary hydroxyproline concentrations in group 1 increased from parturition to d 14; concentrations in group 1 were significantly higher for group 2 after d 5. Mean corrected deoxypyridinoline concentrations in urine increased after parturition to reach a peak at d 9, and serum concentrations of the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen peaked at d 5. However, mean concentrations of deoxypyridinoline and the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen did not differ significantly between groups. The variation in the behavior of the three markers is likely a reflection of the different phases and aspects of the bone collagen degradation. In conclusion, assays for urinary deoxypyridinoline and serum carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen determinations are useful tools to follow the course of degradation of bone collagen in dairy cows.},

Mineral balances (n = 60) were measured during lactation (day 4 to 25) for three successive parities. Mineral retention in the litter was measured by chemical analysis of weaned piglets. The control diet (C) contained 7.2 g P, 9.4 g Ca and 2.6 g Mg kg(-1) DM and the experimental diet (R) 6.5, 8.1, 2.5, respectively. Calculated digestible phosphorus level was 3.5 g kg(-1) DM in both diets. Mean litter size was 10.4 piglets and mean litter gain was 2.7 kg d(-1). Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus retentions in the piglets were not affected by dietary treatments. Mean retention in the sows was slightly negative for calcium and phosphorus, but positive for magnesium. Daily recommended allowances for lactating sows were 23.5 g digestible calcium and 16.5 g digestible phosphorus (both including a safety margin of 25\%). Excretion of phosphorus in urine and faeces on diet R was 0.53 kg and on diet C 0.61 kg during a 25-day lactation. The possibilities for reducing phosphorus excretion during lactation are limited compared to those during pregnancy. Some reduction during lactation can be achieved by increasing phosphorus digestibility in the diet. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

During growth and the first 3 gestations, clinically evident differences were not associated with 2 dietary treatments (approx 12 and 38 g of P/day). During the next 2 gestations (2 years), half the cows from each original treatment group were fed less than 6 g of P (n = 21 cows, 11 from the group fed 12 g of P/day and 10 from the group fed 38 g of P/day) daily. The other half were fed diets supplying approximately 8 g of P (n = 11 cows fed 12 g of P/day) and 35 g of P (n = 10 cows fed 38 g of P/day) daily. During the last 3 years of the experiment, all remaining cows were fed diets containing 12 g (n = 19 cows originally fed 12 g) or 19 g (n = 17 cows originally fed 38 g) of P/day. Cows fed diets containing less than 6 g of P/day developed an insidious and subtle complex syndrome characterized by weight loss, rough hair coat, abnormal stance, and lameness. Spontaneous fractures occurred in the vertebrae, pelvis, and ribs. In severely affected cows, fractures did not heal properly. Some bones were demineralized markedly, and the cortical surfaces were porous, chalky white, soft, and fragile. Osteoid tissue was not properly mineralized. Radiography revealed diminished bone density (osteoporosis), cortical thinning, and resorption of trabeculae. Time-related availability of dietary P initiated excessive turnover of bone, with resultant structural changes and impaired function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Because long-term P feeding studies on dairy heifers are unavailable, 183 Holstein heifers and 182 backcross Holstein x Jersey heifers were offered diets with (SP = 0.40\% of dry matter) and without (NP = 0.30\% of dry matter) supplemental P from 4 to 22 mo of age in a replicated pen design. Forty-eight pens of 8 heifers each were split evenly by breed and treatment group. Heifers were evaluated for body weight (BW), external bone/frame growth, dystocia, calf BW, reproductive efficiency, and first-lactation performance. Growth phase data were analyzed using pen-based statistical models, and lactation data were analyzed using mixed linear models with effects of season of birth, age of dam, heifer pen, sire, sire birth year, and days in milk. Heifers fed NP had similar average daily gain from 170 to 410 and from 410 to 650 d of age compared with heifers fed SP. At 22 mo of age, heifers fed NP did not differ in BW, hip height, hip width, body length, heart girth, cannon bone circumference, or pelvic area compared with heifers fed SP. Blood P concentrations between heifers fed SP or NP did riot differ at 8 or 18 mo of age, and heifers fed SP excreted more P (29.2 vs. 24.2 g/d) than heifers fed NP. As heifers, services per conception and age at pregnancy were not different between heifers fed NP or SP. At parturition, heifers fed NP or SP had similar dystocia scores and calves were similar in BW. Complete first-lactation data (305 d) were available for 333 primiparous cows; and cows fed NP as heifers produced similar milk, fat, and protein compared with cows fed SP as heifers. Days open, days in milk at first breeding, and services per conception also were similar for primiparous cows fed NP or SP as heifers.

	abstract = {Nutrition plays an important role in osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Substantial progress in both laboratory analyses and clinical use of biochemical markers has modified the strategy of anti-osteoporotic drug development. The present review examines the use of biochemical markers in clinical research aimed at characterising the influence of foods or nutrients on bone metabolism. The two types of markers are: (i) specific hormonal factors related to bone; and (ii) bone turnover markers (BTM) that reflect bone cell metabolism. Of the former, vitamin D metabolites, parathyroid hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-I indicate responses to variations in the supply of bone-related nutrients, such as vitamin D, Ca, inorganic phosphate and protein. Thus modification in bone remodelling, the key process upon which both pharmaceutical agents and nutrients exert their anti-catabolic or anabolic actions, is revealed. Circulating BTM reflect either osteoclastic resorption or osteoblastic formation. Intervention with pharmacological agents showed that early changes in BTM predicted bone loss and subsequent osteoporotic fracture risk. New trials have documented the influence of nutrition on bone-tropic hormonal factors and BTM in adults, including situations of body-weight change, such as anorexia nervosa, and weight loss by obese subjects. In osteoporosis-prevention studies involving dietary manipulation, randomised cross-over trials are best suited to evaluate influences on bone metabolism, and insight into effects on bone metabolism may be gained within a relatively short time when biochemical markers are monitored.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review was to focus on the complex relationships between milk and dairy products intake and bone health, with particular emphasis on osteoporosis. The literature was extensively examined to provide an objective overview of the most significant achievements on the subject. Osteoporosis can be defined as a disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk. Although the major determinants of peak bone mass and strength are genetic, major factors during childhood and adolescence may affect the ability to achieve peak bone mass. These include nutrition, particularly calcium and protein intake, physical activity, endocrine status, as well as exposure to a wide variety of risk factors. The role of calcium intake in determining bone mineral mass is well recognized to be the most critical nutritional factor to achieve optimal peak bone mass. The greatest amount of dietary calcium is obtained from milk and dairy foods, which also provide the human diet with vitamin D (particularly for products fortified with vitamin D), potassium, and other macro- and micronutrients. Although studies supporting the beneficial effects of milk or calcium on bone health are predominant in the literature, perplexity or discordance on this subject was expressed by some authors. Discordant data, mainly on the risk of fractures, provided limited proof of the unfavorable effect of dairy intake. More often, discordant works indicate no effect of dairy consumption on bone safety. Some considerations can be drawn from this viewpoint. Milk and dairy products are an optimal source of calcium as well as of other limiting nutrients (e.g., potassium and magnesium), with important effects on bone health. Bioactive components occurring in milk and dairy products may play an essential role on bone metabolism, as shown by in vivo and in vitro studies on colostrum acidic proteins and milk basic proteins. Calcium intake positively affects bone mass and is crucial in childhood and youth for correct bone development. In elderly people, calcium intake as well as vitamin D availability should be carefully checked. As a general conclusion, calcium is essential for bone health, although it will not prevent bone loss due to other factors; in this context, milk and dairy foods are bioavailable, relatively inexpensive sources of calcium for the human diet.},

	abstract = {Despite the significant time and effort spent formulating total mixed rations (TMR), it is evident that the ration delivered by the producer and that consumed by the cow may not accurately reflect that originally formulated. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine how TMR fed agrees with or differs from TMR formulation (accuracy), (2) determine daily variability in physical and chemical characteristics of TMR delivered (precision), and (3) investigate the relationship between daily variability in ration characteristics and group-average measures of productivity [dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, milk components, efficiency, and feed sorting] on commercial dairy farms. Twenty-two commercial freestall herds were visited for 7 consecutive days in both summer and winter months. Fresh and refusal feed samples were collected daily to assess particle size distribution, dry matter, and chemical composition. Milk test data, including yield, fat, and protein were collected from a coinciding Dairy Herd Improvement test. Multivariable mixed-effect regression models were used to analyze associations between productivity measures and daily ration variability, measured as coefficient of variation (CV) over 7d. The average TMR [crude protein=16.5\%, net energy for lactation (NEL) = 1.7 Mcal/kg, nonfiber carbohydrates = 41.3\%, total digestible nutrients = 73.3\%, neutral detergent fiber=31.3\%, acid detergent fiber=20.5\%, Ca = 0.92\%, p=0.42\%, Mg = 0.35\%, K = 1.45\%, Na = 0.41\%] delivered exceeded TMR formulation for NEL (+0.05 Mcal/kg), nonfiber carbohydrates (+1.2\%), acid detergent fiber (+0.7\%), Ca (+0.08\%), P (+0.02\%), Mg (+0.02\%), and K (+0.04\%) and underfed crude protein (−0.4\%), neutral detergent fiber (−0.6\%), and Na (−0.1\%). Dietary measures with high day-to-day CV were average feed refusal rate (CV = 74\%), percent long particles (CV = 16\%), percent medium particles (CV = 7.7\%), percent short particles (CV = 6.1\%), percent fine particles (CV = 13\%), Ca (CV = 7.7\%), Mg (CV = 5.2\%), and Na (CV = 10\%). Every 0.5-percentage-point decrease in daily NEL (CV = 1.2±0.4\%) was associated with 3.2kg/d greater milk yield, 1.0kg/d greater DMI, and 4.3\% greater efficiency of production. Every 5-percentage-point decrease in variability in percent long particles (average percent long = 19.8±6.5; CV = 16.1±6.9\%) in the TMR was associated with 1.2kg/d greater milk yield and a 2.6\% increase in efficiency of milk production. These results demonstrate the importance of ensuring TMR consistency to maximize DMI, production, and efficiency.},

	abstract = {Thirty-nine commercial dairies in Merced County, California were enrolled in the present study to (1) compare lactating cow mineral intakes (via drinking water and total mixed ration) to the National Research Council (NRC) requirements, (2) evaluate the association between dietary concentrations of minerals with and without drinking water and adjusted for mineral concentrations in milk, and (3) compare 4 different methods to estimate excretion of minerals using either assays or estimations of milk mineral outputs and total daily mineral intake per cow with or without minerals coming from drinking water. Dairies were selected to represent a range of herd milk yields and a range of water mineral contents. Samples of total mixed ration, drinking water, and bulk tank milk were taken on 2 different days, 3 to 7 d apart in each farm. Across-farm medians and percentile distributions were used to analyze results. The herd median milk yield interquartile ranged (10th to 90th percentile) from less than 25 to more than 39 kg/d and the concentration of total solids in water interquartile ranged from less than 200 to more than 1,490 mg/L. Including drinking water minerals in the diets increased dietary concentrations by {\textless}4\% for all minerals except for Na and Cl, which increased by 9.3 and 6.5\%, respectively. Concentrations of P and K in milk were essentially the same as the NRC value to estimate lactation requirements. However, NRC milk values of Ca, Cl, and Zn were 10 to 20\% greater than dairy farm values; and Na, Cu, Fe, and Mn were no less than 36\% below NRC values. Estimated excretion of minerals via manure varied substantially across farms. Farms in the 10th percentile did have 2 to 3 times less estimated mineral excretions than those in the 90th percentile (depending on the mineral). Although including water minerals increased excretion of most minerals, the actual median effect of Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, and Mn was less than 5\%, and about 8\% for Na and Cl. Replacing assayed concentrations of minerals in milk with NRC constants resulted in reduced estimated excretion of Ca, Na, Cu, Fe, and Zn, but median differences were {\textless}5\% except for Na which was 7.5\%. Results indicate that not including mineral intake via drinking water and not using assayed concentrations of milk minerals lead to errors in estimation manure excretion of minerals (e.g., Ca, Na, Cl, and S).},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) surplus on dairy farms, especially confined operations, contributes to P buildup in soils with increased potential for P loss to waters. One approach to reduce P surplus and improve water quality is to optimize P feeding and improve P balance on farms. Here we report how varying P concentrations in lactating cow diets affects the amount as well as the chemical forms and fraction distribution of P in fecal excretion, and the environmental implications of this effect. Analysis of fecal samples collected from three independent feeding trials indicates that increasing dietary P levels through the use of P minerals not only led to a higher concentration of acid digest total phosphorus (TP) in feces, but more importantly increased the amount and proportion of P that is water soluble and thus most susceptible to loss in the environment. For instance, with diets containing 3.4, 5.1, or 6.7 g P kg(-1) feed dry matter (DM), the water-soluble fraction of fecal P was 2.91, 7.13, and 10.46 g kg(-1) fecal DM, respectively, accounting for 56, 77, and 83\% of acid digest TP. The other fecal P fractions (those soluble in dilute alkaline and acid extractants) remained small and were unaffected by dietary P concentration. Excess P in the P supplemented diets was excreted in feces as water-soluble forms. A simple measure of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in a single water extract is highly responsive to changes in diet P concentrations and hence can be indicative of dietary P status. A fecal P indicator concept is proposed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Calcium and phosphate regulate numerous biological processes and they are essential for bone mass and bone quality. The calcium and phosphate balance largely depends on intestinal absorption, and the dietary content of these ions determines the type of transport. High dietary intake of calcium and phosphate enables absorption by passive transport, but often the dietary content of these ions is in the low–normal range, especially for calcium. In this condition, the contribution of active intestinal calcium transport will increase to maintain normal serum levels. This adaptation is mainly regulated by the active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, and requires normal concentrations of the precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. When intestinal calcium absorption is insufficient, hormonal adaptations will release calcium from bones to secure normocalcemia, not only by increasing bone loss but also by decreasing bone mineralization. These data underline the fact that adequate calcium intake is critical to secure skeletal integrity. Despite the insights that sufficient dietary calcium intake and normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are critical for calcium and bone homeostasis, surprisingly little is known on the proteins that mediate intestinal calcium transport. Also, the interaction between the intestine and the kidney to control serum phosphate levels is still incompletely understood.},

The cells grow as a monolayer for several months and can be subcultured and cloned in low Ca++ medium. Ultrastructural examination of cells cultured under low Ca++ conditions reveals widened intercellular spaces, abundant microvilli and perinuclear organization of tonofilaments and cellular organelles. Desmosomes are absent. Epidermal cells growing as a monolayer in low Ca++ can be induced to terminally differentiate by adding calcium to the level normally found in the culture medium (1.2 mM). Cell-to-cell contact occurs rapidly and desmosomes form within 2 hr. The cells stratify by 1–2 days and terminally differentiate with cell sloughing by 3–4 days. After Ca++ addition, DNA synthesis decreases with a lag of 5–10 hr and is totally inhibited within 34 hr. In contrast, RNA and protein synthesis continue at 40–50\% of the low Ca++ level at day 3, a time when many cells are detaching from the culture dish. Keratin synthesis is unaffected by the Ca++ switch.},

	abstract = {During the early postpartum period dairy cows mobilize fat and muscle to support lactation. This is associated with alterations in blood metabolite and hormone profiles which in turn influence milk yield and fertility. This study developed models to determine how metabolic traits, milk yield and body condition score were inter-related at different times in the periparturient period and to compare these relationships in primiparous (PP, n=188) and multiparous (MP, n=312) cows. Data from four previous studies which included information on blood metabolic parameters, parity, milk yield, body condition score and diet were collated into a single dataset. Coefficients of polynomial equations were calculated for each trait between -1 week pre-calving and week +7 postpartum using residual maximum likelihood modelling. The completed dataset was used in a multiple correlation model to determine how the best fit curves were related to each other over time. PP cows had higher concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I and lower beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations throughout, higher leptin concentrations pre-partum and both the peak in non-esterified fatty acids and the nadir in urea concentration occurred earlier after calving. These differences were associated with significantly lower milk production. Leptin concentrations fell at calving and were related to body condition score. Insulin was negatively correlated with yield in MP cows only. In MP cows the relationship between insulin-like growth factor-I and yield switched from negative to positive between weeks +4 and +7. Both beta-hydroxybutyrate and urea were positively related to yield in PP cows. In contrast, in MP cows beta-hydroxybutyrate was negatively correlated with yield and urea was strongly related to body condition score but not yield. These results suggest that there are differences in the control of tissue mobilization between PP and MP cows which may promote nutrient partitioning into growth as well as milk during the first lactation.},

In total, a set of 349 cow milk samples, 200 ewe milk samples, and 332 goat milk samples were both analyzed by MIR and by gas chromatography, the reference method. A broad FA variability was ensured by using milk from different breeds and feeding systems. The methods studied were partial least squares regression (PLS), first-derivative pretreatment + PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS, wavelets + PLS, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO), and elastic net. The best results were obtained with PLS, genetic algorithm + PLS and first derivative + PLS. The residual standard deviation and the coefficient of determination in external validation were used to characterize the equations and to retain the best for each FA in each species. In all cases, the predictions were of better quality for FA found at medium to high concentrations (i.e., for saturated FA and some monounsaturated FA with a coefficient of determination in external validation {\textgreater}0.90). The conversion of the FA expressed in grams per 100mL of milk to grams per 100g of FA was possible with a small loss of accuracy for some FA.},

The dimensionality of traits was reduced by principal components analysis. Therefore, 46 principal components describing 99.03\% of the phenotypic variability were used to create 46 new traits. Variance components were estimated using canonical transformation. Heritability ranged from 0 to 0.35. Twenty-five out of 46 studied traits showed a permanent environment variance greater than genetic variance. Eight traits showed heritability greater than 0.10. Variances of original spectral traits were obtained by back transformation. Heritabilities for each spectral data points ranged from 0.003 to 0.42. In particular, 3 MIR regions showing moderate to high heritability estimates were of potential genetic interest. Heritabilities for specific wave numbers, linked with common milk traits (e.g., lipids, lactose), were similar to those estimated for these traits. This research confirms the genetic variability of the MIR milk spectrum and, therefore, the genetic variation of milk components. The objective of this study was to better understand the genetics of milk composition and, maybe in the future, to select animals to improve milk quality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Most of the non-bovine milk proteins are homologous with the recognized families of those of Bos taurus, αs1-caseins, αs2-caseins, β-caseins, K-caseins, β-lactoglobulins, and α-lactalbumins, each family representing a separate genetic locus specific to the mammary gland. No prominent milk protein not homologous to one of these families has yet been discovered in milk of any species. Genetic polymorphism resulting from substitutions in the polypeptide chains and various degrees of post-translational phosphorylation, glycosylation, and proteolysis have been identified in milk proteins of several species. Total protein production ranges among species from about 0.5 to 10 g/d per kg0.75 maternal weight. Proportions of the several proteins vary greatly among species, but few accurate analytical data are available except for total casein and total whey protein contents.},

Magnesium has been subject to less research than calcium in both aspects. Magnesium is present in cows' milk in similar to 10\% of the concentration of calcium. About two-thirds of the magnesium is soluble, whereas about one third of calcium is soluble. Although magnesium is less significant than calcium in dairy systems, it warrants more investigation. Magnesium plays numerous physiological roles in the human body and is implicated in many critical health issues such as metabolic syndrome and skeletal muscle loss. Despite its well-established significance in health, magnesium is often reported as an under-consumed nutrient. Milk and dairy products are already one of the main sources of dietary magnesium. There is an opportunity to develop milk and dairy products as efficient vehicles for supplementary dietary magnesium delivery with more research into fortification options. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major constraint to the productivity of breeder herds grazing low-P rangelands due to adverse effects on growth and fertility. However, P supplementation during the wet season, when additional dietary P is most needed, is often difficult due to practical constraints. Body P reserves in breeders can be mobilised and alleviate dietary P deficiency within an annual cycle. Approaches to estimate bone P reserves and net mobilisation or replenishment of P from the analysis of rib and hip (tuber coxae) biopsies are discussed. In at least some circumstances, breeder cows grazing P-deficient pastures mobilise bone P to alleviate the effects of diet P deficiency. Recent experiments with breeders have investigated mobilisation of body P to alleviate the adverse effects of dietary P deficiency during pregnancy and early lactation, and subsequent replenishment of body P reserves. Both mature cows and first-calf cows (FCC) calving in a high P status and fed severely P-deficient diets during lactation were able to mobilise sufficient body P reserves to provide milk for moderate calf growth (viz. 0.6–0.8 kg liveweight (LW)/day for 3 months), but this was associated with rapid cow-LW loss and markedly decreased bone P content. First-calf cows appear to have lesser capacity than mature cows to mobilise body P. FCC fed P-adequate diets during late pregnancy maintained high voluntary intakes and had higher LW and bone P reserves at calving. When fed a P-deficient diet during early lactation, these greater bone P reserves were utilised. Bone P reserves can be replenished by P-adequate diets fed post-weaning. Breeder management that relies more on mobilising body P reserves when P demands are high and on replacing these body P reserves when P demands are lower offers an opportunity to alleviate the effects of dietary P deficiencies during the early wet season in situations where P supplementation is not possible.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40104-016-0101-0},
	abstract = {Background: Calcium is a vital mineral and an indispensable component of milk for ruminants. The regulation of transcellular calcium transport by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25-(OH)(2)D-3, the active form of vitamin D) has been confirmed in humans and rodents, and regulators, including vitamin D receptor (VDR), calcium binding protein D-9k (calbindin-D-9k), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1b (PMCA1b), PMAC2b and Orai1, are involved in this process. However, it is still unclear whether 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 could stimulate calcium transport in the ruminant mammary gland. The present trials were conducted to study the effect of 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 supplementation and energy availability on the expression of genes and proteins related to calcium secretion in goat mammary epithelial cells. Methods: An in vitro culture method for goat secreting mammary epithelial cells was successfully established. The cells were treated with different doses of 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 (0, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 100.0 nmol/L) for calcium transport research, followed by a 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism) treatment to determine its dependence on glucose availability. Cell proliferation ratios, glucose consumption and enzyme activities were measured with commercial kits, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blots were used to determine the expression of genes and proteins associated with mammary calcium transport in dairy goats, respectively. Results: 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 promoted cell proliferation and the expression of genes involved in calcium transport in a dose-dependent manner when the concentration did not exceed 10.0 nmol/L. In addition, 100.0 nmol/L 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of associated genes compared with the 10.0 nmol/L treatment. The inhibition of hexokinase 2 (HK2), a rate-limiting enzyme in glucose metabolism, decreased the expression of PMCA1b and PMCA2b at the mRNA and protein levels as well as the transcription of Orai1, indicating that glucose availability was required for goat mammary calcium transport. The optimal concentration of 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 that facilitated calcium transport in this study was 10.0 nmol/L. Conclusions: Supplementation with 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 influenced cell proliferation and regulated the expression of calcium transport modulators in a dose-and energy-dependent manner, thereby highlighting the role of 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 as an efficacious regulatory agent that produces calcium-enriched milk in ruminants when a suitable energy status was guaranteed.},

	abstract = {In the context of the PhénoFinLait project, a genome-wide analysis was performed to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect milk protein composition estimated using mid-infrared spectrometry in the Montbéliarde (MO), Normande (NO), and Holstein (HO) French dairy cattle breeds. The 6 main milk proteins (α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and αS1-, αS2-, β-, and κ-caseins) expressed as grams per 100g of milk (\% of milk) or as grams per 100g of protein (\% of protein) were estimated in 848,068 test-day milk samples from 156,660 cows. Genotyping was performed for 2,773 MO, 2,673 NO, and 2,208 HO cows using the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Individual test-day records were adjusted for environmental effects and then averaged per cow to define the phenotypes analyzed. Quantitative trait loci detection was performed within each breed using a linkage disequilibrium and linkage analysis approach. A total of 39 genomic regions distributed on 20 of the 29 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) were significantly associated with milk protein composition at a genome-wide level of significance in at least 1 of the 3 breeds. The 9 most significant QTL were located on BTA2 (133 Mbp), BTA6 (38, 47, and 87 Mbp), BTA11 (103 Mbp), BTA14 (1.8 Mbp), BTA20 (32 and 58 Mbp), and BTA29 (8 Mbp). The BTA6 (87 Mbp), BTA11, and BTA20 (58 Mbp) QTL were found in all 3 breeds, and they had highly significant effects on κ-casein, β-lactoglobulin, and α-lactalbumin, expressed as a percentage of protein, respectively. Each of these QTL explained between 13\% (BTA14) and 51\% (BTA11) of the genetic variance of the trait. Many other QTL regions were also identified in at least one breed. They were located on 14 additional chromosomes (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, and 27), and they explained 2 to 8\% of the genetic variance of 1 or more protein composition traits. Concordance analyses, performed between QTL status and sequence-derived polymorphisms from 13 bulls, revealed previously known causal polymorphisms in LGB (BTA11) and GHR (BTA20 at 32 Mbp) and excluded some other previously described mutations. These results constitute a first step in identifying causal mutations and using routinely collected mid-infrared predictions in future genomic selection programs to improve bovine milk protein composition.},

	abstract = {The incidence of hypocalcemia increases in high-parity dairy cows because resorption of bone Ca is delayed in these animals, and they appear to have a reduced ability to absorb Ca from the intestine during the early postpartum period. Difructose anhydride (DFA) III has been shown to promote the absorption of intestinal Ca via a paracellular pathway. However, past studies have not reported this effect in peripartum dairy cows. Therefore, we investigated the effect of DFA III supplementation on Ca metabolism during the peripartum period to determine whether DFA III promotes intestinal Ca absorption via this route. Seventy-four multiparous Holstein cows were separated into DFA and control groups based on their parity and body weight. The feed of the DFA group was supplemented with 40 g/d of DFA III from −14 to 6 d relative to calving. The control group did not receive DFA III. At calving (0 h relative to calving), serum Ca declined below 9 mg/dL in both groups. However, serum Ca concentrations were greater in the DFA group than in the control group at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h relative to calving, and the time required for serum Ca to recover to 9 mg/dL during the postpartum period was shorter in the high-parity cows in the DFA group than in those in the control group. Parathyroid hormone concentrations increased immediately after calving in both groups and were greater in the control group than in the DFA group at 12 and 24 h relative to calving. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations increased at 0 and 12 h relative to calving in both groups and were higher in the control group than in the DFA group at 72 h relative to calving. Serum concentrations of the bone-resorption marker cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) were not different between the groups during peripartum period, and serum NTX in all cows was lower at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h relative to calving than at −21, 4, and 5 d relative to calving. Thus, DFA treatment induced faster recovery of serum Ca, although bone resorption was restrained. In conclusion, DFA III promotes intestinal passive Ca absorption via the paracellular pathway during the early postpartum period; this absorption is unaffected by aging.},

	abstract = {The protein and fat content of Dutch bulk milk has been monitored since the 1950s and has increased considerably, by 11 and 20\%, respectively, whereas milk yield has more than doubled. The change in protein and fat content of milk is advantageous for the dairy industry, as these are the 2 most economically valuable constituents of milk. Increases in protein and fat content of milk have allowed increases in the yield of various products such as cheese and butter. However, for cheese and other applications where casein micelles play a crucial role in structure and stability, it is not only casein content, but also the properties of the casein micelles that determine processability. Of particular importance herein is the salt partition in milk, but it is unknown whether increased protein content has affected the milk salts and their distribution between casein micelles and milk serum. It was, therefore, the objective of this research to determine the salt composition and protein content for individual cow milk and bulk milk over a period of 1 yr and to compare these data to results obtained during the 1930s, 1950s, and 1960s in the last century. Calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus content were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and inorganic phosphate, citrate, chloride, and sulfate content by anion-exchange chromatography in bulk milk and milk ultracentrifugate. In addition, ionic calcium and ionic magnesium concentration were determined by the Donnan membrane technique. We concluded that historical increase in milk yield and protein content in milk have resulted in correlated changes in casein content and the micellar salt fraction of milk. In addition, the essential nutrients, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in milk have increased the past 75 yr; therefore, the nutritional value of milk has improved.},

	abstract = {Milk and milk products are nutritious food items containing numerous essential nutrients, but in the western societies the consumption of milk has decreased partly due to claimed negative health effects. The content of oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids, short- and medium chain fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds may promote positive health effects. Full-fat milk has been shown to increase the mean gastric emptying time compared to half-skimmed milk, thereby increasing the gastrointestinal transit time. Also the low pH in fermented milk may delay the gastric emptying. Hence, it may be suggested that ingesting full-fat milk or fermented milk might be favourable for glycaemic (and appetite?) regulation. For some persons milk proteins, fat and milk sugar may be of health concern. The interaction between carbohydrates (both natural milk sugar and added sugar) and protein in milk exposed to heat may give products, whose effects on health should be further studied, and the increasing use of sweetened milk products should be questioned. The concentration in milk of several nutrients can be manipulated through feeding regimes. There is no evidence that moderate intake of milk fat gives increased risk of diseases.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a global health problem that will take on increasing significance as people live longer and the world's population continues to increase in number. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop and implement nutritional approaches and policies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, to develop preventative strategies, it is important to determine which modifiable factors, especially nutritional factors, are able to improve bone health throughout life. The present review will firstly, and very briefly, define the principal disease of bone mass (i.e., osteoporosis) and its risk factors, and will then focus on the importance of ‘milk minerals’ in bone health. While there are 20 essential minerals, and all of these are present in milk at some concentration, for the purposes of this review only a selected number of minerals (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium and zinc) will be discussed in relation to bone health.},

Sampling, sample preparation, and analysis of the samples were performed under carefully controlled contamination-free conditions. The dairy cattle breeds were Danish-Holstein or Jersey. Sources of variance were quantified, and differences between production systems and breeds were tested. The major source of variation for most elements was week of sampling. Concentrations of Al, Cu, Fe, Mo, Rb, Se, and Zn were within published ranges. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Mn and Pb were lower, and concentrations of Co and Sr were higher than published ranges. Compared with Holsteins, Jerseys produced milk with higher concentrations of Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Rh, and Zn and with a lower concentration of Bi. The organically produced milk, compared with conventionally produced milk, contained a significantly higher concentration of Mo (48 v. 37 ng/g) and a lower concentration of Ba (43 v. 62 ng/g), Eu (4 v. 7 ng/g), Mn (16 v. 20 ng/g) and Zn (4400 v. 5150 ng/g respectively). The investigation yielded typical concentrations for the following trace elements in milk, for which no or very few data are available: Ba, Bi, Ce, Cs, Eu, Ga, Gd, In, La, Nb, Nd, Pd, Pr, Rh, Sb, Sm, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, Y, and Zr.},

	abstract = {Dairy cows suffer blood Ca losses as lactation begins and might be affected by hypocalcemia in its clinical (total serum Ca concentration {\textless}1.50 mM) or subclinical form (total serum Ca concentration ≤2.14 mM). Several studies have suggested that hypocalcemia is associated with different health problems of the cow but results from different studies are not consistent. The objective of this study was to assess potential associations between subclinical hypocalcemia (SCHC) and displaced abomasum, intramammary infections, metritis, retained placenta, and ketosis. Also, the associations between SCHC and milk yield and reproductive function were evaluated. After discarding cows (32) with clinical hypocalcemia, a total of 764 cows from 6 different commercial farms were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected at 24 to 48 h postcalving and analyzed for total Ca concentration. Odds ratios of the different afflictions potentially associated with SCHC were calculated. Seventy-eight percent of the analyzed cows incurred SCHC. The occurrence of displaced abomasum, ketosis, retained placenta, and metritis was 3.7, 5.5, 3.4, and 4.3 times more likely, respectively, in cows that had SCHC than in cows with normocalcemia. Furthermore, the risk of incurring retained placenta or metritis increased in multiparous cows as serum Ca concentrations decreased compared with that in primiparous cows. Normocalcemic cows, independent of parity, were more likely to show their first estrus sooner after calving than SCHC cows, but no correlation was found between SCHC and other reproductive parameters. Different serum Ca concentration cutoffs were identified for several postpartum afflictions (≤1.93, ≤2.05, ≤2.05, and ≤2.10 mM for ketosis, retained placenta, metritis, and displaced abomasum, respectively). In conclusion, SCHC, defined as serum Ca ≤2.14 mM, is a frequent illness affecting the majority of the dairy cows with important repercussions on health. However, if SCHC were to be used to predict postpartum disease, different serum Ca cutoff points are likely to be needed because best predictive cutoff values varied among postpartum ketosis, displaced abomasum, retained placenta, and metritis.},

	issn = {0378-7346},
	abstract = {Parathyroid-hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is found in high concentrations in human milk. One of the possible physiological roles of PTHrP may be the regulation of calcium transport through the mammary gland. The relationship between milk PTHrP and Ca concentrations was evaluated in lactating women in the present study. Milk PTHrP has been quantified by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). The IRMA detects PTHrP 1-72, and the RIA carboxyterminal region of PTHrP (C-PTHrP). Milk PTHrP 1-72 and C-PTHrP concentrations did not significantly change by breast-feeding. Milk PTHrP 1-72 changed significantly by the time of day, in contrast to C-PTHrP. Thus, PTHrP 1-72 rather than C-PTHrP may reflect an acute change in mammary PTHrP secretion. In lactating women in whom milk PTHrP and calcium concentrations were serially measured at 5-day intervals up to 26-30 days after delivery, milk PTHrP 1-72 progressively increased with duration of lactation. In contrast to PTHrP 1-72, milk C-PTHrP decreased during this period. And milk PTHrP 1-72 levels inversely correlated with C-PTHrP levels. Milk C-PTHrP but not PTHrP 1-72 levels correlated significantly with milk Ca concentrations. Although it is not certain whether the correlation between milk C-PTHrP and Ca levels is causally related, it may be that fragments of PTHrP detected as C-PTHrP are involved in the regulation of Ca transport through the mammary gland in women.},

	abstract = {Confidence intervals for blood parameters used for nutritional and metabolic profile testing in cattle were calculated for clinically normal lactating Holstein cows, taking into account the effects of parity, stage of lactation, and season. Blood samples were collected from 740 cows in 33 Italian dairy herds according to a predefined protocol. Herds were visited during summer and the following winter, sampling 12 lactating cows at each visit (4 primiparous and 8 multiparous). Six cows were selected from the early-lactation group (days in milk: 10 to 89) and the other 6 were selected from the mid-lactation group (days in milk: 90 to 215). Cow selection criteria excluded animals clinically exposed to periparturient diseases as well as animals not considered in good health by a veterinary clinical examination. For each blood variable, outliers were identified and discarded. Data were then analyzed for their Gaussian distribution and variables with not normal distribution were log-transformed to adjust for lack of normality. Herd mean values were calculated for each blood parameter according to 3 main classification factors: parity (primiparous vs. multiparous), stage of lactation (early vs. mid) and season of production (summer vs. winter). The resulting data set was statistically analyzed using a mixed model with the fixed effects of these factors, their interactions, and the random effect of herd. General 95\% confidence intervals were calculated for blood variables that showed a relevant herd variance component such as albumin, triglycerides, aspartate, urea, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, direct and total bilirubin, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. For the remaining parameters, specific confidence intervals were calculated for each level of the significant main factors. Parity affected blood concentration of total protein, globulin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine kinase, and phosphorus. Blood nonesterified fatty acids, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, creatinine kinase and cholesterol were influenced by stage of lactation. The season of production had a significant effect on total protein, globulin, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine. The outcomes of this work will improve the accuracy of the biochemical profile as a tool for dairy practitioners to assess the metabolic status of lactating Holstein cows.},

Blood was sampled on d 0, 1, and 3 postpartum for assessment of neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activities. Blood was also sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 DIM for determination of serum concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose. On the basis of receiver operator characteristic curves, subclinical hypocalcemia (SCH) was defined as a serum Ca concentration ≤8.59 mg/dL in at least 1 sample in the first 3 DIM. The overall incidences of metritis and puerperal metritis were 47.3 and 30\%, respectively. Concentration in blood and percentages of neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis and oxidative burst were all reduced in cows with SCH compared with normocalcemic cows. Cows with SCH were at a greater risk of developing fever, metritis, and puerperal metritis compared with normocalcemic cows. Among cows at low risk of developing metritis, those with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (40.7\%) compared with normocalcemic cows (14.3\%). Similarly, among cows at high risk of developing metritis, cows with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (77.8\%) compared with normocalcemic cows (20.0\%). Cows with SCH had elevated concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate compared with normocalcemic cows. The relative risk of developing metritis decreased by 22\% for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum Ca. Neither metritis nor SCH influenced the resumption of estrous cyclicity by 38 DIM, but cows with SCH had a reduced pregnancy rate and a longer interval to pregnancy compared with normocalcemic cows. Finally, the population risk to develop uterine diseases attributable to SCH was 66.6\% for metritis and 91.3\% for puerperal metritis in the present study.},

Samples of blood plasma showed that cows consuming the anionic diet maintained calcium and phosphorus through parturition, whereas cows consuming the cationic diet decreased in these minerals around calving. Hydroxyproline was higher for cows consuming the anionic diet during the peripartal period compared to cows consuming the cationic diet. Milk produced in the lactation subsequent to prepartum treatment was 6.8\% less for cows offered the cationic diet.

	abstract = {A study was conducted to determine the effect of supplementation of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) on nutrient utilization, milk production, its composition and reproductive performance of Nili-Ravi buffaloes. Twelve lactating buffaloes were randomly divided into three groups, with 4 animals in each group, fed diets containing 80, 100 and 120\% NRC recommended Ca and P, respectively. Daily feed consumption and milk yield (MY) were recorded. Fortnightly collected milk samples were analyzed for total solids (TS), milk protein (MP), milk fat (MF), lactose, Ca and P contents. Calcium and P concentrations were also determined in blood serum. Milk yield was 10\%, MF 4\% and TS 3.7\% higher in buffaloes fed on 120\% Ca and P than those fed on 100\% Ca and P of NRC recommendation but dry matter intake was similar among all groups. However, MP, lactose and solids not fat were not affected by mineral supplementation. In milk, slightly increased concentrations of Ca and P were noted during the last two weeks of experiment in all groups. Dietary protein digestibility was higher in buffaloes fed 120\% Ca and P, crude fibre and dry matter digestibility was higher in 80 and 100\% Ca and P supplemented groups respectively however, difference was non-significant among the groups. Serum P concentration was higher but Ca was lower in 120\% Ca and P supplemented group compared to other two groups however, these values were within the normal range. Buffaloes fed 120\% Ca and P conceived 100\% but in buffaloes fed 100 and 80\% Ca and P, conception rates were 75 and 50\% respectively. Number of services per conception was lower in buffaloes fed 120\% Ca and P supplemented diet. It may be concluded that 120\% Ca and P supplementation increased milk production and reproductive performance of lactating buffaloes. (C) 2010 PVJ. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {Buffaloes are the second most widely available milk source in the world after cow milk with similar to 13.0\% (more than 93 out of 727 billion liters) annual production (FAOSTAT, 2011). The overall volume of buffalo milk produced can be considered twice due to higher total solids contents as compared to cow milk. Typical average milk compositions are readily available for major and minor components but information on the seasonal variations in chemical composition of buffalo milk is limited rather unavailable. Data presented in this study can be useful for the manufactures of diverse dairy products with respect to compositional variations and desired characteristics based on major components in different seasons during the whole year. Physicochemical, compositional and mineral contents of buffalo milk as a function of a one-year's cycle, were analyzed. Average contents of total solids, fat, lactose, crude protein, ash and conjugated linoleic acid in the milk were 17.2\%, 7.3\%, 4.6\%, 5.0\%, 0.91\%, and 6.0 mg.g(-1) fat, respectively which varied throughout the year. The average mineral contents of calcium, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, sodium and zinc in the milk were 1799, 1217, 844, 337 and 7 mg.kg(-1), respectively, and remained about steady throughout the year. The results indicated that the buffalo milk is a rich source of nutrients and are nutritionally preferable to cows' milk for developing children, pregnant and lactating women as little quantity as compared to cow, goat, camel and human milk can provide recommended daily allowance of nutrients to them.},

	abstract = {We investigated milk nutrient composition from three Asian elephant cows over the first 3 years of lactation, including two consecutive lactations in one cow. Body mass gain is presented for three calves during the first year. Milk samples (n = 74) were analyzed for dry matter (DM), fat, crude protein (CP), sugar, ash, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K); gross energy (GE) was calculated. Concentrations of most nutrients changed over lactation: DM, fat, CP, Ca, P, and GE were positively correlated to calf age; sugar was negatively correlated to calf age. GE doubled between birth (1 kcal/g) and 2 years of age (2 kcal/g). After accounting for calf age, GE, fat, Ca, and P concentrations differed among the cows. Milk composition also differed between two lactations from the same cow. When milk nutrients were expressed on a mg per kcal basis, the pattern changes: CP, Ca, and P remained relatively constant over lactation on a per energy basis. Calf mass quadrupled over the first year of life; mass gain was linear at 0.9 kg/day. Asian elephant milk composition is variable, both across lactations and between cows, complicating efforts to determine representative values for comparative studies and for the formulation of elephant milk formulas. The fact that CP, Ca, and P were all relatively constant when expressed on a per energy basis may be of biological significance. The increase in nutrient density over lactation undoubtedly limits maternal water loss, reducing the volume of milk necessary to support the calf. Zoo Biol 32:291-298, 2013.

	abstract = {The stress of parturition in the dairy cow is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious disease. During the periparturient period the demands for calcium are increased; these increased demands for calcium can result in subclinical or clinical hypocalcemia. Periparturient cows also experience significant immune suppression. Because intracellular calcium signaling is a key early feature in immune cell activation, we have hypothesized that the increased demand for calcium in periparturient cows may adversely affect intracellular calcium stores of immune cells. This reduction in intracellular calcium stores in immune cells could blunt intracellular calcium release following an activating stimulus, contributing to the immune suppression seen in these animals. To test this hypothesis, peripheral mononuclear cells were obtained from 27 multiparous dairy cows spanning a period of 2 wk before and 2 wk after parturition. Following activation of these cells by anti-CD3 antibodies plus secondary antibodies, intracellular calcium release from intracellular stores was measured. The intracellular calcium released in response to the activation signal declined as calcium demand for lactation became more intense and recovered as plasma calcium normalized. Intracellular calcium stores in peripheral mononuclear cells, estimated by pretreating cells with pervanadate and ionomycin, significantly decreased at parturition and returned to normal levels as the cows’ blood calcium returned to normal levels. Hypocalcemia, which is common in periparturient dairy cows, is associated with decreased intracellular calcium stores in peripheral mononuclear cells. Our data suggest that this is the cause of a blunted intracellular calcium release response to an immune cell activation signal. It is concluded that intracellular Ca stores decrease in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before parturition and development of hypocalcemia. This suggests that systemic calcium stress precedes measurable hypocalcemia, particularly in cows that will develop milk fever. Therefore, PBMC intracellular Ca stores are a more sensitive measure of calcium stresses in transition cow. This decrease in PBMC intracellular Ca stores before parturition and the development of hypocalcemia contributes to periparturient immune suppression.},

In our studies, plasma Ca concentration changes effected by various oral Ca preparations were compared. Solutions were administered by oral drenching of cows, and blood was obtained hourly. Calcium chloride increased plasma Ca better than Ca propionate, which increased plasma Ca better than Ca carbonate. A CaCl2 gel formulation increased plasma Ca better than Ca carbonate, but not as well as did Ca propionate. Concentrated solutions of Ca as CaCl2 increased plasma Ca better than diluted solutions. Rumen bypass of Ca salts increased plasma Ca concentration more than when Ca salts were placed into the rumen. Oral administration of 50 g of Ca as CaCl2 raised plasma Ca concentrations to the same extent as 4 g of Ca as CaCl2 given i.v. We also examined effects of oral Ca salts on plasma Ca concentrations of hypocalcemic periparturient cows and found that oral Ca treatment could treat mild cases of hypocalcemia. We also caution that CaCl2 use must be limited because excessive amounts cause severe metabolic acidosis.},

Cows were fed one of six diets differing in K and Ca contents. In addition, the effect of dietary Na (tested only at the high concentration of dietary Ca, and low concentration of dietary K) was examined. Treatments were arranged in an incomplete 2 × 4 factorial design; dietary Ca (0.5 or 1.5\%) and dietary strong cations (1.1, 2.1, and 3.1\% K or 1.3\% Na) were the main effects. Dietary Ca did not significantly affect the incidence of milk fever or the degree of hypocalcemia experienced by the cows. Milk fever occurred in 2 of 20 cows that were fed the prepartum diet containing 1.1\% K and 0.12\% Na. Increasing dietary K to 2.1 or 3.1\% increased the incidence of milk fever to 10 of 20 cows and 11 of 23 cows, respectively. Increasing dietary Na to 1.3\% in the diet containing 1.5\% Ca induced milk fever in 5 of 8 cows. Addition of strong cations to the prepartum diet increased blood and urine pH and reduced plasma hydroxyproline concentrations, suggesting that bone resorption of Ca is inhibited in cows fed high K or high Na diets as a result of metabolic alkalosis. These data demonstrated that dietary Ca concentration is not a major risk factor for milk fever and that dietary strong cations, especially K, induce metabolic alkalosis in the prepartum dairy cow, which reduces the ability of the cow to maintain Ca homeostasis.},

Ten cows were left untreated to serve as controls. Incidence of parturient paresis among control animals was 80\% (8/10). Treatment reduced the incidence of parturient paresis to 9\% (1/11).

Intramuscular injection and implantation resulted in plasma 24F-1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations above 300 pg/ml for the first 48 h after administration. From d 4 until d 11 after administration, plasma concentration was maintained between 164 and 89 pg/ml in the implanted steers.

Blood hematocrit and hemoglobin of newborn calves increased with greater lactation number of the dams, and the blood values were lowest at d 6 postpartum for calves born from primiparous cows. Plasma Ca of calves born from primiparous cows tended to be higher than those of calves from multiparous cows, and blood hemoglobin and plasma inorganic P concentrations of female calves were higher than those of males at d 1 postpartum. Blood hematocrit and hemoglobin and plasma Mg decreased with time postpartum, but plasma Zn and Cu increased. In general, lactation number was a major factor for alteration of colostral minerals of cows and mineral status of newborn calves.},

	abstract = {Mammary gland development is controlled by a dynamic interplay between endocrine hormones and locally produced factors. Biogenic monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and others) are an important class of bioregulatory molecules that have not been shown to participate in mammary development. Here we show that mammary glands stimulated by prolactin (PRL) express genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis (tryptophan hydroxylase [TPH] and aromatic amine decarboxylase). TPH mRNA was elevated during pregnancy and lactation, and serotonin was detected in the mammary epithelium and in milk. TPH was induced by PRL in mammosphere cultures and by milk stasis in nursing dams, suggesting that the gene is controlled by milk filling in the alveoli. Serotonin suppressed β-casein gene expression and caused shrinkage of mammary alveoli. Conversely, TPH1 gene disruption or antiserotonergic drugs resulted in enhanced secretory features and alveolar dilation. Thus, autocrine-paracrine serotonin signaling is an important regulator of mammary homeostasis and early involution.},

	abstract = {Ion channels on the surface membrane of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) are the proximal cause of an action potential. Each individual channel type has been thoroughly characterized under voltage clamp, and the ensemble of the ion channel currents reconstructed in silico generates rhythmic action potentials. Thus, this ensemble can be envisioned as a surface "membrane clock" (M clock). Localized subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases are generated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors during late diastolic depolarization and are referred to as an intracellular "Ca(2+) clock," because their spontaneous occurrence is periodic during voltage clamp or in detergent-permeabilized SANCs, and in silico as well. In spontaneously firing SANCs, the M and Ca(2+) clocks do not operate in isolation but work together via numerous interactions modulated by membrane voltage, subsarcolemmal Ca(2+), and protein kinase A and CaMKII-dependent protein phosphorylation. Through these interactions, the 2 subsystem clocks become mutually entrained to form a robust, stable, coupled-clock system that drives normal cardiac pacemaker cell automaticity. G protein-coupled receptors signaling creates pacemaker flexibility, ie, effects changes in the rhythmic action potential firing rate, by impacting on these very same factors that regulate robust basal coupled-clock system function. This review examines evidence that forms the basis of this coupled-clock system concept in cardiac SANCs.},

	abstract = {Calcium homeostasis during lactation is critical for maternal and neonatal health. We previously showed that nonneuronal/peripheral serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] causes the lactating mammary gland to synthesize and secrete PTHrP in an acute fashion. Here, using a mouse model, we found that genetic inactivation of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in peripheral 5-HT synthesis, reduced circulating and mammary PTHrP expression, osteoclast activity, and maternal circulating calcium concentrations during the transition from pregnancy to lactation. Tph1 inactivation also reduced sonic hedgehog signaling in the mammary gland during lactation. Each of these deficiencies was rescued by daily injections of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (an immediate precursor of 5-HT) to Tph1-deficient dams. We used immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts to demonstrate that 5-HT induces PTHrP through a sonic hedgehog-dependent signal transduction mechanism. We also found that 5-HT altered DNA methylation of the Shh gene locus, leading to transcriptional initiation at an alternate start site and formation of a variant transcript in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro and in mammary tissue in vivo. These results support a new paradigm of 5-HT-mediated Shh regulation involving DNA methylation remodeling and promoter switching. In addition to having immediate implications for lactation biology, identification and characterization of a novel functional regulatory relationship between nonneuronal 5-HT, hedgehog signaling, and PTHrP offers new avenues for the study of these important factors in development and disease.},

	abstract = {Lactation is characterized by massive transcellular flux of calcium, from the basolateral side of the mammary alveolar epithelium (blood) into the ductal lumen (milk). Regulation of calcium transport during lactation is critical for maternal and neonatal health. The monoamine serotonin (5-HT) is synthesized by the mammary gland and functions as a homeostatic regulation of lactation. Genetic ablation of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in non-neuronal serotonin synthesis, causes a deficiency in circulating serotonin. As a consequence maternal calcium concentrations decrease, mammary epithelial cell morphology is altered, and cell proliferation is decreased during lactation. Here we demonstrate that serotonin deficiency decreases the expression and disrupts the normal localization of calcium transporters located in the apical (PMCA2) and basolateral (CaSR, ORAI-1) membranes of the lactating mammary gland. In addition, serotonin deficiency decreases the mRNA expression of calcium transporters located in intracellular compartments (SERCA2, SPCA1 and 2). Mammary expression of serotonin receptor isoform 2b and its downstream pathways (PLCβ3, PKC and MAP-ERK1/2) are also decreased by serotonin deficiency, which might explain the numerous phenotypic alterations described above. In most cases, addition of exogenous 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to the Tph1 deficient mice rescued the phenotype. Our data supports the hypothesis that serotonin is necessary for proper mammary gland structure and function, to regulate blood and mammary epithelial cell transport of calcium during lactation. These findings can be applicable to the treatment of lactation-induced hypocalcemia in dairy cows and can have profound implications in humans, given the wide-spread use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as antidepressants during pregnancy and lactation.},

Automated milk meters were used to measure the DMY. Mineral composition was determined by using the Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometric (ICP-OES) method. The data collected from milk yield and mineral composition were analysed using the general linear model of SAS. The results showed that milk yield was highest from Friesian cows both in spring and winter seasons while Jersey cows had the lowest yield. Seasonal effects were also observed in mineral concentrations, with winter having higher values for aluminium, boron, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, zinc and sodium while phosphorus was higher in spring. Crossbred cows yielded higher concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. It was therefore concluded that both milk yield and mineral compositions are affected by genotype and season.},

The 116 milk sample data were analysed to build a five-class milk quality typology. This typology was then confronted to the management practices. The main factors influencing the variability of herd milk were the season, and the level and nature of feeding. The milks highest in fat and proteins contents were produced in the winter, particularly when the animals were fed temperate forages. Regarding hygienic quality, the best results were obtained in the winter and spring, in areas with low rainfall. None of the five milk classes combined on a same period high fat and protein contents, and low levels of butyric spore and somatic cell counts. An important margin of progress in mastering these main quality parameters appeared. This could be realised by adapting feeding practices and/or herd management techniques that were identified in the study.},

We explored field suitability, precision and accuracy of this device for in-vivo third metacarpal density assessment. Precision was analysed by calculating measurement variation under repeated measurement tests with (reproducibility) and without (repeatability) limb repositioning. Repeatability and reproducibility were tested ex-vivo, at the same time that intra- and inter-operator reproducibility were assessed in-vivo. In order to test accuracy, bone mineral content (BMC) of several bone samples determined by DXA and ashing were compared. Repeatability was 1.47\% and reproducibility 1.69\% ex-vivo. In-vivo reproducibility varied between 2.91 and 4.06\% for intra-operator test and between 3.13 and 5.53\% for inter-operator test. BMC measured by DXA and ash weight were highly correlated (R2{\textgreater}0.99). In conclusion, under described conditions this DXA device is usable, accurate and precise. Its sensitiveness reaches 8.23\% in an individual longitudinal monitoring. Using the third metacarpal bone as an example, we have shown that this device is suitable for experimental or clinical monitoring.},

However, over the past decade, substantial advances have been made in understanding the control of phosphorus by the so-called phosphatonin system, the lynchpin of which is fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 binds to the klotho/FGFR1c receptor complex in renal tubular epithelial cells, leading to upregulation of Na/Pi cotransporters and subsequent excretion of phosphorus from the body. In addition, FGF23 inhibits parathyroid hormone and the renal 1α-hydroxylase enzyme, while it stimulates 24-hydroxylase, leading to decreased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. FGF23 is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, particularly the hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets group and chronic kidney disease, and is a target for the development of new treatments in human medicine. Little work has been done on FGF23 or the other phosphatonins in veterinary medicine, but increases in FGF23 are seen with chronic kidney disease in cats, and increased FGF23 expression has been found in soft tissue sarcomas in dogs.},

	abstract = {In view of environmental concerns with regard to phosphorus (P) pollution and the expected global P scarcity, there is increasing interest in improving P utilization in dairy cattle. In high-producing dairy cows, P requirements for milk production comprise a significant fraction of total dietary P requirements. Although variation in P content of milk can affect the efficiency of P utilization for milk production (i.e. the fraction of ingested P that is incorporated in milk), this variation is poorly understood. It was hypothesized that the P content of milk is related to both milk protein and milk lactose content, but not necessarily to milk fat content. Three existing experiments comprising individual animal data on milk yield and fat, protein, lactose and P content of milk (in total 278 observations from 121 cows) were analysed to evaluate this hypothesis using a mixed model analysis. The models including the effects of both protein and lactose content of milk yielded better prediction of milk P content in terms of root-mean-square prediction error (RMSPE) and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) statistics than models with only protein included as prediction variable; however, estimates of effect sizes varied between studies. The inclusion of milk fat content in equations already including protein and lactose did not further improve prediction of milk P content. Equations developed to describe the relationship between milk protein and lactose contents (g/kg) and milk P content (g/kg) were: (Expt 1) P in milk = -0.44(+/- 0.179) + 0.0253(+/- 0.00300) x milk protein + 0.0133(+/- 0.00382) x milk lactose (RMSPE: 5.2\%; CCC: 0.71); (Expt 2) P in milk = -0.26 (+/- 0.347) + 0.0174(+/- 0.00328) x milk protein + 0.0143 (+/- 0.00611) x milk lactose (RMSPE: 6.3\%; CCC: 0.40); and (Expt 3) P in milk = -0.36(+/- 0.255) + 0.0131(+/- 0.00230) x milk protein + 0.0193(+/- 0.00490) x milk lactose (RMSPE: 6.5\%; CCC: 0.55). Analysis of the three experiments combined, treating study as a random effect, resulted in the following equation to describe the same relationship as in the individual study equations: P in milk = -0.64(+/- 0.168) + 0.0223(+/- 0.00236) x milk protein + 0.0191(+/- 0.00316) x milk lactose (RMSPE: 6.2\%; CCC: 0.61). Although significant relationships between milk protein, milk lactose and milk P were found, a considerable portion of the observed variation remained unexplained, implying that factors other than milk composition may affect the P content of milk. The equations developed may be used to replace current fixed milk P contents assumed in P requirement systems for cattle.},

Infusion periods lasted 4 days, with a 5-day washout between periods. Cows were infused at a constant rate for 1 h each day. Blood was collected pre- and 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-infusion, urine was collected pre- and post-infusion, and milk was collected daily. All of the 5-HTP doses increased systemic serotonin as compared to the 0 mg/kg dose, and the 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg doses increased circulating glucose and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and decreased beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta HBA) concentrations. Treatment of cows with either 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg 5-HTP doses decreased urine calcium elimination, and the 1.5 mg/kg dose increased milk calcium concentrations. No differences were detected in the heart rates, respiration rates, or body temperatures of the cows; however, manure scores and defecation frequency were affected. Indeed, cows that received 5-HTP defecated more, and the consistency of their manure was softer. Treatment of late-lactation dairy cows with 5-HTP improved energy metabolism, decreased loss of calcium into urine, and increased calcium secretion into milk. Further research should target the effects of increasing serotonin during the transition period to determine any benefits for post-parturient calcium and glucose metabolism.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine variations in posttranslational modifications (PTM) of caseins (CN) in milk from individual cows and determine how these differ between breeds, across lactation, and between variants. Furthermore, we examined the variation of casein PTM in relation to rennet coagulation. properties of milk. In total, detailed protein composition of milk from 892 Danish Holstein and Jersey cows was determined by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The method measured relative contents of the main milk proteins as well as several variants and PTM. The results showed that the 2 breeds had distinct milk protein composition. Milk from Danish Holstein cows was mainly characterized by higher relative contents of beta-CN, alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA), and beta-lactoglobulin, and a higher fraction of glycosylated kappa-CN (G kappa-CN), whereas milk from Danish Jersey cows was characterized by higher relative contents of kappa-CN, alpha(S2)-CN, and the less phosphorylated forms of alpha(S1)-CN and alpha(S2)-CN. Univariate linear models including days in milk and parity as class effects showed variation in the detailed protein profile across and between lactations; in particular, changes in the degree of glycosylation of kappa-CN were pronounced, but changes in alpha(S1)-CN 8P to total alpha(S1)-CN and alpha(S2)-CN 11P to alpha(S2)-CN were also observed over lactation for both breeds. The phosphorylated forms of alpha(S1)-CN and alpha(S2)-CN were, to some extent, correlated. Further, the kappa-CN BB genotype was associated with higher relative contents of both unglycosylated kappa-CN (UG kappa-CN) and G kappa-CN compared with kappa-CN AA; kappa-CN AB showed intermediate results in both breeds. The influence of protein composition on rennet coagulation properties was explored based on 4 classes for curd firming rate: noncoagulation, and poor, average, and good coagulation. The results revealed breed differences: Holstein milk, higher relative content of kappa-CN to total protein, and higher content of G kappa-CN were associated with improved milk coagulation. In contrast, relative content of alpha-LA was the main component associated with milk Coagulation properties in Danish Jerseys and it was shown to affect milk coagulation properties negatively. In addition, variation in phosphorylation degrees of alpha(S1)-CN also played a role. This study demonstrates that although the genetic influence of glycosylation seems to be the same in both breeds, nongenetic variation differs, which is further reflected in different associations with milk coagulation properties.},

In cultured mammary tissues from 12- to 14-day-pregnant mice, the intracellular concentration of (PO4)-P-32 was six times higher than in the culture medium after a 4-h treatment with (PO4)-P-32. Of the principal lactogenic hormones [insulin (I), cortisol (H), and prolactin (PRL)], only I and PRL (in the presence of H and I) stimulated (PO4)-P-32 uptake into cultured mammary tissues; H, by itself or in the presence of I or PRL, inhibited (PO4)-P-32 uptake. All three lactogenic hormones together effected the greatest stimulation of (PO4)-P-32 uptake. Similar hormone effects were observed with regard to (PO4)-P-32 incorporation into lipids and trichloroacetic acid-insoluble molecules. In a time course study, the onset of the PRL stimulation of (PO4)-P-32 uptake and incorporation occurred 8-12 h after PRL addition; in dose-response studies, the PRL effect was manifested with PRL concentrations of 50 ng/ml and above. From kinetic studies, the apparent maximal velocity of PO4 uptake was determined to be similar to7.7 mM.h(-1).l cell water(-1); the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant was similar to3-5 mM. The PRL effect on (PO4)-P-32 uptake was abolished when sodium was absent from the uptake medium. These studies thus demonstrate a complex interaction of three hormones (I, H, and PRL) in the regulation of (PO4)-P-32 uptake and incorporation into macromolecules in cultured mouse mammary tissues.},

	abstract = {Various biochemical markers help to evaluate the state of bone turnover in humans and could be used during the peri-parturient period in dairy cows when calcium (Ca) metabolism changes dramatically. To investigate this, the peri-partum characteristics of serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) were investigated. Both serum BAP activity and urinary DPD concentrations were increased and demonstrated wide variability in younger animals, and these findings were consistent with other bone turnover markers. Around the time of parturition, serum Ca concentration and serum BAP activity in multiparous cows were significantly lower than in primiparous cows, but urinary DPD concentration was unchanged. The use of BAP as a bone formation marker appears to be valuable for evaluating bone remodelling status in cows, but the specificity of the test needs to be confirmed. The DPD/BAP ratio around parturition demonstrated a clear difference in bone turnover status between the two parity groups with multiparous cows demonstrating increased signs of bone resorption compared with primiparous cows, corresponding to the Ca requirement for milk production. In future studies, the applicability of the ratio of bone resorption marker to bone formation marker should be evaluated for bone turnover assessment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Between 14 days before calving and 21 days after calving, the serum osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the primiparous cows than in the multiparous cows. A comparison between age-matched non-periparturient and periparturient cows showed that serum osteocalcin levels were significantly lowered during late gestation in both primiparous and multiparous cows.

Fixed effects considered in the analyses were herd of sampling, parity, lactation stage and a two-way interaction between parity and lactation stage; an additive genetic and residual term were included in the models as random effects. Estimates of heritability for Ca, P and TA were 0.10, 0.12 and 0.26, respectively. Positive moderate to strong phenotypic correlations (0.33 to 0.82) existed between Ca, P and TA, whereas phenotypic weak to moderate correlations (0.00 to 0.45) existed between these traits with both milk quality and yield. Moderate to strong genetic correlations (0.28 to 0.92) existed between Ca, P and TA, and between these predicted traits with both fat and protein percentage (0.35 to 0.91). The existence of heritable genetic variation for Ca, P and TA, coupled with the potential to predict these components for routine cow milk testing, imply that genetic gain in these traits is indeed possible.},

It was more of a trial and error method that various peoples gradually learned that certain diseases were associated in some way with diet and that specific foods were helpful in their treatments.  It was not until the last half of the 19th century there was a realization that food was made up of classes of nutrients, which included an ill-defined supply of inorganic salts. Mineral Nutrition, The Early Years, contains 16 chapters of historical information related to deficiency and toxicity of mineral elements.  The first chapter is an introduction dealing with historical considerations, classification, distribution, developing the science of nutrition, general mineral functions, methods of analyses, requirements, bioavailability, status detection and incidence of mineral deficiencies and toxicities.  Chapters 2 through 13 emphasize historical discovery and development of 14 elements but also includes information on chemical properties, functions, sources and deficiencies and toxicities in humans and animals.  Chapters 14 and 15 deal with history of the minerals more commonly associated with a toxicity (fluorine, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, aluminum and molybdenum).  Chapter 16 is history of the “newer trace elements”.Keywords: Minerals, Elements, Nutrition History, Essential Minerals, Mineral Deficiencies},

The goats were given similar diets with various concentrations of P, and 32P was injected to trace the movement of P in the body. A P metabolism model with four pools was developed to compute P exchanges in the system. The results showed that P absorption, bone resorption, and excretion of urinary P and endogenous and fecal P all play a part in the homeostatic control of P. Endogenous fecal output was positively correlated to P intake (P {\textless} .01). Bone resorption of P was not influenced by intake of P, and P recycling from tissues to the blood pool was lesser for low P intake. Endogenous P loss occurred even in animals fed an inadequate P diet, resulting in a negative P balance. The extrapolated minimum endogenous loss in feces was .067 g of P/d. The minimum P intake for maintenance in Saanen goats was calculated to be .61 g of P/d or .055 g of P/(kg(.75) x d) at 25 kg BW. Model outputs indicate greater P flow from the blood pool to the gut and vice versa as P intake increased. Intake of P did not significantly affect P flow from bone and soft tissue to blood.

Calcium intake had no significant effect on plasma concentration of calcium or parathyroid hormone. It had a slight but significant effect on the plasma phosphorus concentration. As calcium intake increased, calcium absorption increased but calcium removal from bone decreased so that total calcium transport into the exchangeable pool remained fairly constant. A decline in calcium clearance with age was accompanied by a fall in plasma parathyroid hormone concentration, and a decrease in calcium transport into the pool. These observations are consistent with feedback controls between plasma calcium, parathyroid hormone and calcium transport operating to maintain plasma calcium homeostasis as calcium clearance declined with advancing age.},

Twelve Santa Ines male sheep, 8 mo of age, with average BW of 31.6 kg were injected with 32P and 45Ca to trace the movement of P and Ca in the body. The original model had 4 pools representing the gut, plasma, soft tissues, and bone. In the revised model, instantaneous values rather than averages for pool derivatives were incorporated, and the model was extended to represent absorption and excretion of phytate P explicitly. The amendments improved the model, resulting in higher flows between plasma and bone than between plasma and tissue and, therefore, a more accurate representation of P metabolism. Phosphorus and Ca metabolism were then assessed conjointly using the revised model. The results showed that P and Ca metabolism are closely related as evidenced by the ratio of these minerals in the bidirectional flows between plasma and bone and between plasma and tissue. Phytate P digestibility was 47\%, and P retention was negative (-1.4 g/d), suggesting that a feed characteristic impaired P utilization and led to P deficiency. The revised model provides an improved prediction of P and Ca metabolism that can be used to assess mineral requirements and to estimate losses to the environment.},

Prepartum dairy cows (primiparous, n = 445; multiparous, n = 328) from 1 dairy herd were monitored (prepartum pen) for imminent signs of parturition (appearance of amniotic sac outside the vulva) until birth. All calves were subject to the same newborn care, colostrum management, and failure of passive transfer assessment (serum total protein ≤5.5 mg/dL). Serum total calcium of cows was determined in samples taken within 2 h after calving. To define HYPO cows after calving, a cut-point of total serum Ca concentration with optimal sensitivity and specificity to predict metritis or calf diarrhea was established by using the receiver operator characteristic. The effect of HYPO on survival (died or culled within 60 DIM), health status, and pregnancy per artificial insemination (PAI) for first services of lactating cows were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Additionally, the effect of HYPO at calving on days in milk (DIM) at first service (DIMFS), milk yield (kg), milk components (percent fat and protein), and somatic cell count were analyzed for the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) tests using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The effect of parity (primiparous and multiparous), body condition score at calving, and manure hygiene score at calving were also included in the statistical models. The effect of HYPO at calving on calf survival, serum total protein, and diarrhea within 10 d of age were assessed using GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. The overall prevalence of HYPO was 14.6\% (2.7\% for primiparous and 30.8\% for multiparous cows). Cows experiencing HYPO at calving had greater proportion of metritis (25.1 vs. 14.7\%) and culling within 60 DIM (15.9 vs. 6.8\%) compared with non-HYPO cows, respectively. For the first 3 DHIA tests, milk yield and components did not differ between HYPO and non-HYPO cows. The DIMFS as well as proportion of cows with dystocia, births of twins, mastitis, and PAI at first service were not different between HYPO and non-HYPO cows. The proportion of stillbirth, weaned calves, and serum total protein did not differ between calves born from HYPO or non-HYPO cows. However, calves born from HYPO cows had greater incidence of diarrhea (49\%) than calves born (33.3\%) from non-HYPO cows. Findings from the present study showed that HYPO at calving had significant health implications for both dams and calves under certified organic management.},

In a prospective cohort study, 97 cows on 2 dairy farms with automatic milking systems were monitored for subclinical hypocalcemia. Animals were enrolled 7 ± 3 days prior to estimated calving date and three parity groups were defined based on the lactation that the animals were going to start: lactation = 1, lactation = 2, and lactation ≥3. Serum calcium concentration (Ca) was measured in all animals in the first 3 DIM and subclinical hypocalcemia (SCH) was defined as Ca ≤ 8.6 mg/dL; animals that presented a low Ca level during all 3 days were classified as chronic SCH (cSCH). Return to cyclicity during the voluntary waiting period was analyzed based on weekly progesterone concentrations measured in serum. Information on reproductive outcomes (i.e., number of breedings, pregnancy status, days open, etc.), were collected from on-farm software after all study cows had completed their study period. Chronic SCH was present in all parity groups with higher incidence in multiparous animals (20\% of parity = 1, 32\% of parity = 2; and 46\% of parity ≥ 3 animals). The cSCH animals took longer to show active ovaries when compared to eucalcemic and SCH animals. In a multivariable Cox's Proportional Hazard model animals with normal Ca were 1.8 times more likely to return to cyclicity by the end of the voluntary waiting period when compared to cSCH animals. Animals with cSCH also had 0.27 odds of being pregnant at first service compared to eucalcemic cows when analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. Subclinical hypocalcemia had a negative effect on return of ovarian function during the voluntary waiting period and decreased the odds of pregnancy at first service. Those cows with cSCH had an even more pronounced impaired reproductive function than those with one subclinical measurement.},

	abstract = {Overfeeding minerals to dairy herds will raise diet cost, increase their excretion into the environment and for minerals such as copper (Cu) can lead to poisoning and cow death. In contrast, underfeeding may compromise cow performance, health and fertility. Despite this, the level of mineral intake on commercial dairy units is poorly documented. To determine the mineral intake on commercial dairy herds in central and northern England over the winter of 2011/12 and compare these to recommended levels, samples of compound feed, forage mix, supplementary sources (including lick blocks, rumen boluses, free access minerals and drenches) and drinking water were collected from 50 herds over the winter feeding period and analysed for 10 macro and trace minerals. For cows in early lactation the mean dietary concentration of phosphorus (P) was 4·5 g/kg dry matter (DM) (s.d. 0·70), 0·1 g/kg DM below UK requirements, and for calcium (Ca) was 10·2 g/kg DM (s.d. 2·94), 5·9 g/kg DM above requirements. Trace mineral concentrations were also in excess of requirements in early lactation, with a mean dietary Cu concentration of 28 mg/kg DM (s.d. 9·85), approximately 18 mg/kg DM above UK requirements, with 32 of the 50 herds feeding above the UK industry recommended maximum of 20 mg/kg DM and 6 above the EU limit of 40 mg/kg DM. Dietary mineral concentrations were generally lower in late lactation but still higher than requirements. The forage mix (including supplementary feeds and minerals) contributed the greatest amount of minerals, with percentile ranges (10th–90th) of 2·1–4·4 g/kg diet DM for P, 1·4–3·2 g/kg diet DM for magnesium (Mg) and 5·3–25·0 mg/kg diet DM for Cu. Compounds fed in the milking parlour supplied (10th–90th percentile) 0·0–1·4 g P g/kg diet DM, 0·0–1·2 g Mg/kg diet DM and 0·0–11·6 mg Cu/kg diet DM. For the upper 90th percentile of dairy herds, water supplied proportionally 0·08 of Ca requirements recommended in early lactation in the UK, whilst supplementary mineral sources supplied up to 0·64 of Cu and 0·43 of zinc (Zn) requirements. High dietary concentrations of Cu were not justified by the presence of the dietary antagonist molybdenum (Mo), with no relationship between the two minerals in early or late lactation diets. In conclusion, most dairy herds were feeding excess amounts of minerals over the winter feeding period when compared to UK or other national recommended guidelines, with the implications of a higher diet cost and negative impact on the environment and animal health.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate mathematical models that predict mineral excretion, particularly calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and selenium (Se), from lactating dairy cows. Mineral excretion can be affected by several dietary factors. A deficiency in Ca or Mg application to pasture, among other factors, can contribute to grass tetany or wheat pasture poisoning in cows, whereas an excess can cause runoff into water supplies. Manure application with high Se concentration can also result in runoff, causing the bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic ecosystems, wetland habitats and estuaries, leading to toxic levels in fish. A database composed of studies relating to mineral utilisation in lactating dairy cows conducted after and including the year 2000 was compiled. A meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of creating multiple empirical equations to predict Ca, Mg and Se excretion from lactating dairy cows. Calcium intake, feed Ca content, milk yield, milk protein content and acid detergent fibre content in diet were positively and linearly related to Ca excretion. Dietary crude protein content and milk fat content were negatively related to Ca excretion. Magnesium intake, feed Mg content and milk yield were positively and linearly related to Mg excretion. Selenium content of diet and dry matter intake were linearly and positively related to Se excretion. Two sets of models were developed using or excluding the intake variable and both sets of models were evaluated with independent data originating from commercial herd or individual animals. In general, intake measurements improved prediction when evaluated with independent datasets (root mean square prediction error = 8\% to 19\% vs 14\% to 26\% of the average observed value). There were substantial mean biases, particularly those evaluated with data from a commercial farm, perhaps due to inaccurate feed intake measurements. Although there was generally good agreement between predicted and observed mineral excretion, model development and evaluation would benefit from an expanded database.},

	abstract = {Sodium bicarbonate (SB) is a common dairy feed supplement, although recent research on its rumen buffering efficacy in contemporary dairy diets with low starch levels is limited. In California, and other areas of the world, new environmental regulations aim to minimize the amount of fixed solids (FS), including Na, which are discharged from dairy farms. Our aim was to determine effects of SB or calcium magnesium carbonate (CMC; a potential alternative buffer which does not contribute to Na discharge), on performance of early lactation high producing Holstein cows. The study was a Latin square design with 3 periods of 28d, 3 treatments (i.e., control (C), SB, CMC) and 3 pens of ∼310 cows. The total mixed ration was supplemented with 8g/kg dry matter (DM) of SB or CMC, and contained 519g/kg DM and 158g/kg crude protein (CP), 334g/kg aNDF (i.e., neutral detergent fiber assayed with a heat stable amylase expressed inclusive of residual ash) and 160g/kg starch (DM basis). The dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) for the C, SB and CMC supplemented diets was 375, 456 and 381mEq (Na+K−Cl)/kg DM, respectively. The DM intake for C, SB and CMC cows did not differ (28.2, 28.5, 28.6kg/d, respectively), but the SB supplemented diet tended (P=0.053) to reduce DM digestibility (637 versus 656g/kg DM) and increase (P=0.09) fecal pH (6.65 versus 6.60) compared to C. The CMC supplemented cows had higher (P{\textless}0.001) fecal pH than C cows (6.76 versus 6.60), but digestibility did not differ. SB supplemented cows had lower (P{\textless}0.01) milk yield (45.2 versus 46.2kg/d) and higher (P{\textless}0.01) milk fat (35.6 versus 34.3g/kg), but milk fat yield did not differ (1.60 versus 1.58kg/d) compared to C. The C and CMC supplemented cows did not differ in milk yield (46.2 versus 45.7kg/d) or composition. Changes in body condition score were similar for C and SB supplemented cows, but tended (P=0.08) to be lower for CMC versus SB supplemented cows (−0.07, −0.09, −0.03units/30d for C, SB and CMC cows, respectively), and net energy (NEl) output (172.4, 170.9, 173.2MJ/d), and diet NEl concentration (6.12, 6.00, 6.06MJ/kg DM) for C, SB and CMC supplemented diets did not differ. Results suggest that SB buffered the rumen and/or improved acid base balance by increasing DCAD, and that CMC buffered the abomasum and lower gastrointestinal tract. However, for diets and conditions comparable to this study, use of neither SB nor CMC is supported due to similar animal performance.},

In trial 1, four fistulated Holstein cows were arranged in a 4 x 4 Latin square design and received 0, 750, 1500, and 2250 g of glucose/d in the duodenum. In trial 2, five fistulated Holstein cows were arranged in a 5 x 5 Latin square design and received 0, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 g/d of glucose. In both trials, cows were fed a basal diet of 38\% grass silage, 10\% dehydrated alfalfa, 49\% energy concentrate, and 3\% oil meal. The treatments (feed plus infusion) were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Increased amounts of glucose increased milk yield up to 2.4 and 1.6 kg/d in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Lactose content was not affected, while fat yield and content decreased linearly. The decrease in milk fat resulted from a reduced yield of C18, probably caused by a lower mobilization of fat. The glucose treatments significantly affected the profiles of medium-chain fatty acids, by enhancing the elongation process (up to C14). Glucose infusions induced an asymptotic response of protein yield (linear increase up to 1000 g of glucose, after ceiling). It appears that with poor postruminal starch diets, such as grass silage-based diets containing 35 to 40\% of concentrate, the glucose supply to the mammary gland may be limiting for milk synthesis.},

	abstract = {With increasing popularity, growth curve modeling is more and more often considered as the 1st choice for analyzing longitudinal data. Although the growth curve approach is often a good choice, other modeling strategies may more directly answer questions of interest. It is common to see researchers fit growth curve models without considering alterative modeling strategies. In this article we compare 3 approaches for analyzing longitudinal data: repeated measures analysis of variance, covariance pattern models, and growth curve models. As all are members of the general linear mixed model family, they represent somewhat different assumptions about the way individuals change. These assumptions result in different patterns of covariation among the residuals around the fixed effects. In this article, we first indicate the kinds of data that are appropriately modeled by each and use real data examples to demonstrate possible problems associated with the blanket selection of the growth curve model. We then present a simulation that indicates the utility of Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion in the selection of a proper residual covariance structure. The results cast doubt on the popular practice of automatically using growth curve modeling for longitudinal data without comparing the fit of different models. Finally, we provide some practical advice for assessing mean changes in the presence of correlated data.},

In this review we break down transcellular calcium transport into the tasks of calcium entry, calcium sequestration and compartmentalization, and calcium extrusion. We compare and contrast the steps of calcium transport into milk by mammary epithelial cells, and the specific molecules that might perform these tasks, with well-characterized calcium transport mechanisms in other epithelia, such as the kidney, small intestine, and salivary gland. Finally, we suggest an updated model for calcium transport into milk that incorporates calcium transport across the apical plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {This review deals with the cellular mechanisms that transport milk constituents or the precursors of milk constituents into, out of, and across the mammary secretory cell. The various milk constituents are secreted by different intracellular routes, and these are outlined, including the paracellular pathway between interstitial fluid and milk that is present in some physiological states and in some species throughout lactation. Also considered are the in vivo and in vitro methods used to study mammary transport and secretory mechanisms. The main part of the review addresses the mechanisms responsible for uptake across the basolateral cell membrane and, in some cases, for transport into the Golgi apparatus and for movement across the apical membrane of sodium, potassium, chloride, water, phosphate, calcium, citrate, iodide, choline, carnitine, glucose, amino acids and peptides, and fatty acids. Recent work on the control of these processes, by volume-sensitive mechanisms for example, is emphasized. The review points out where future work is needed to gain an overall view of milk secretion, for example, in marsupials where milk composition changes markedly during development of the young, and particularly on the intracellular coordination of the transport processes that result in the production of milk of relatively constant composition at a particular stage of lactation in both placental and marsupial mammals.},

This disease occurs at the time of parturition and is unique to adult dairy animals. The disease results from the inability of animals to cope with the sudden demand for calcium in support of colostrum formation. Animals developing the disease become hypocalcemic and require intravenous calcium to survive. The precise metabolic disorder(s) responsible for the onset of milk fever is still being debated.

The concentration of unoccupied receptor (femtomoles per mg protein) was significantly higher in the intestine (666 ± 19 vs. 162 ± 43) and bone (61 ± 3.7 vs. 18 ± 2.5) of young rats compared to that in adults. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the intestinal receptor, however, remained very similar at both ages (young, 0.24 nM; adult, 0.53 nM). A similar age-related decline in unoccupied intestinal receptor was also observed in Fischer 344 rats and cows. Infusion of young and adult Holtzman rats with about 72 ng/kg BW 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in similar changes in the concentrations of plasma 1,25-(OH)2D3 (150-160 pg/ml) in both age groups. The 1,25-(OH) infusions also resulted in significant up-regulation of unoccupied intestinal receptor (femtomoles per mg protein) from 512 ± 27 to 780 ± 61 in the young rats and 68 ± 9.4 to 194 ± 15 in the adult rats. Receptor upregulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (change from control) was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in young rats (268 ± 51 fmol/mg protein) than in adults (125 ± 8.2 fmol/mg protein). These data suggest that the differences in receptor number in young and adult rats may be responsible for functional changes in target tissue response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 associated with advancing age.

	abstract = {Mathematical models for predicting P excretions play a key role in evaluating P use efficiency and monitoring the environmental impact of dairy cows. However, the majority of extant models require feed intake as predictor variable, which is not routinely available at farm level. The objectives of the study were to (1) explore factors explaining heterogeneity in P output; (2) develop a set of empirical models for predicting P output in feces (Pf), manure (PMa), and milk (Pm, all in g/cow per day) with and without dry matter intake (DMI) using literature data; and (3) evaluate new and extant P models using an independent data set. Random effect meta-regression analyses were conducted using 190 Pf, 97 PMa, and 118 Pm or milk P concentration (PMilkC) treatment means from 38 studies. Dietary nutrient composition, milk yield and composition, and days in milk were used as potential covariates to the models with and without DMI. Dietary phosphorus intake (Pi) was the major determinant of Pf and PMa. Milk yield negatively affected Pi partitioning to Pf or PMa. In the absence of DMI, milk yield, body weight, and dietary P content became the major determinants of Pf and PMa. Milk P concentration (PMilkC) was heterogeneous across the treatment groups, with a mean of 0.92 g/kg of milk. Milk yield, days in milk, and dietary Ca-to-ash ratio were negatively correlated with PMilkC and explained 42\% of the heterogeneity. The new models predicted Pf and PMa with root mean square prediction error as a percentage of observed mean (RMSPE\%) of 18.3 and 19.2\%, respectively, using DMI when evaluated with an independent data set. Some of the extant models also predicted Pf and PMa well (RMSPE\% = 19.3 to 20.0\%) using DMI. The new models without DMI as a variable predicted Pf and PMa with RMSPE\% of 22.3 and 19.6\%, respectively, which can be used in monitoring P excretions at farm level. When evaluated with an independent data set, the new model and extant models based on milk protein content predicted PMilkC with RMSPE\% of 12.7 to 19.6\%. Although models using P intake information gave better predictions, P output from lactating dairy cows can also be predicted well without intake using milk yield, milk protein content, body weight, and dietary P, Ca, and total ash contents.},

	abstract = {The means by which calcium is transported into the milk produced by mammary glands is a poorly understood process. One hypothesis is that it occurs during exocytosis of secretory products via the Golgi pathway, consistent with the observation that the SPCA1 Ca2+-ATPase, which is expressed in the Golgi, is induced in lactating mammary tissue. However, massive up-regulation of the PMCA2bw plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase also occurs during lactation and is more strongly correlated with increases in milk calcium, suggesting that calcium may be secreted directly via this pump. To examine the physiological role of PMCA2bw in lactation we compared lactating PMCA2-null mice to heterozygous and wild-type mice. Relative expression levels of individual milk proteins were unaffected by genotype. However, milk from PMCA2-null mice had 60\% less calcium than milk from heterozygous and wild-type mice, the total milk protein concentration was lower, and an indirect measure of milk production (litter weights) suggested that the PMCA2-null mice produce significantly less milk. In contrast, lactose was higher in milk from PMCA2-null mice during early lactation, but by day 12 of lactation there were no differences in milk lactose between the three genotypes. These data demonstrate that the activity of PMCA2bw is required for secretion of much of the calcium in milk. This major secretory function represents a novel biological role for the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases, which are generally regarded as premier regulators of intracellular Ca2+.},

The remaining 20\% is contained in nucleotides, such as ATP, nucleic acids, phospholipids, and a host of other phosphorylated compounds needed for metabolism. Scheidler and Sell conducted research in which laying hens were fed varying concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and phytate phosphorus in an attempt to determine the effect of phytase and calcium on phosphorus balance. Many studies have been conducted to determine the relative availability of different phosphorus sources for ruminants. Ammerman and colleagues fed wethers and steers low phosphorus hay and concentrate diet in a series of absorption trials and showed that calcium metaphosphate (50\%) and calcium pyrophosphate (0\%) provided less available phosphorus than monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (100\%). The ratio of calcium to phosphorus has a large influence on the availability of phosphorus from a feedstuff. A major consideration with respect to phosphorus availability is the proportion of phosphorus in plant products in the form of phytic acid. It was suggested by the NRC that phosphorus in corn was 12\% available to swine and that in soybean meal was 25\%. Phosphorus bioavailability has been studied more extensively than most other elements since it is a much more costly item in commercial diet formulations. Phosphorus in many inorganic sources and in meat and fish meals is highly available to monogastric animals.},

The remaining 1\% is extremely important in cellular metabolism, blood clotting, enzyme activation, and neuromuscular action. Animal weight gain, bone breaking strength, tibia ash, and various parameters of calcium metabolism have been used by many researchers as useful indicators to measure available calcium in the diet. Yoshida and Hoshii fed combinations of calcium and phosphorus to broiler chicks and found that toe ash correlated well with tibia hardness. Radioisotopes have been quite useful to determine the availability of calcium from several sources. Several factors have been shown to influence absorption of calcium from the gut. Absorption of calcium in the anterior small intestine is both an active (mediated by vitamin D) and a passive process. Several reports have indicated that particle size is a major determinant of calcium and phosphorus availability in defluorinated phosphates. Calcium availability, as determined by radio-calcium recoveries from pair-fed 25 kg barrows, was 42\% in a cereal grain-based diet. Feedstuffs that are considered to have relative calcium bioavailability values, for both nonruminants and ruminants, of 95\% or more in comparison to calcium carbonate include aragonite, bone meal, calcium gluconate, dicalcium phosphate, ground eggshell, ground limestone, ground oyster shell, calcium sulfate, nonfat dry milk, and tricalcium phosphate.},

Both cell types are under multi-hormone control. New research findings demonstrate that bone formation by osteoblasts is negatively regulated by the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipocytes and acts through the leptin receptor in the central nervous system and ultimately through the sympathetic nervous system. Leptin deficiency leads to increased osteoblast activity and increased bone mass. Reciprocally, expression of the Esp gene, exclusive to osteoblasts, regulates glucose homeostasis and adiposity through controlling the osteoblastic secretion of the hormone-like substance osteocalcin. An undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin acts as a regulator of insulin in the pancreas and adiponectin in the adipocyte to modulate energy metabolism. Osteocalcin deficiency in knockout mice leads to decreased insulin and adiponectin secretion, insulin resistance, higher serum glucose levels and increased adiposity.},

	abstract = {Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), which causes hypercalcemia associated with malignant tumors, is known to be present in milk. Gene expression of PTHrP in the mammary gland increases markedly during parturition and with the onset of lactation. Even when circulating PTHrP levels are extremely low or below the detection limit, milk PTHrP levels are remarkably high. Parathyroid hormone-related protein derived from the mammary gland is assumed to play a role in maintaining the maternal calcium homeostasis and calcium transport from blood to milk. In previous studies that determined the PTHrP concentrations in milk, the pretreatments and diluent composition were not standardized. Here, we investigated the effect of various pretreatment procedures and diluent constitutions and the consequent PTHrP concentrations in commercial milk and milk products in Japan. Significant differences were found in PTHrP concentrations in raw milk samples subjected to different combinations of pretreatments (mixing, centrifugation, acidification, and heating) and diluents (0 pM standard solution of PTHrP, plasma treated with protease inhibitors, and original diluent). We measured the PTHrP concentrations in normal liquid milk, processed milk, milk drinks, formulated milk powders, and skim milk powder by using the appropriate combination of pretreatment (acidification) and diluent (plasma treated with protease inhibitors). The PTHrP concentration in normal liquid milk, processed milk, and skim milk powder was as high as that in raw milk ({\textgreater}5 nM), whereas that in milk drinks differed considerably. The PTHrP concentration in infant formulas ({\textless}2 nM) was lower than that in the other milk products. These results indicate that a certain amount of PTHrP is ingested when milk and milk products are consumed.},

Eight cows were fed a high-calcium diet (80 g/day) and eight were fed a low-calcium diet (8 g/day) at least 14 days before parturition. Calcium concentrations in plasma decreased after initiation of feeding either diet, but cows fed low-calcium diet tended to have lower prepartum calcium and phosphorus and greater peripartal calcium in plasma. Hydroxyproline in plasma was greater during peripartal period in cows fed low-calcium diet. Prepartum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in plasma tended to be greater in cows fed low calcium. Increases in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were only 2 and 3 days after initiation of the low-calcium diet; during the first 2 days after parturition, however, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D tended to be lower in those cows fed low calcium. As parturition neared, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D tended to be lower in cows fed the low calcium-diet. Usual early postpartum changes in calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and hydroxyproline were seen during first few days after initiation of feeding low calcium. Thus, we propose that the preventative action of the low-calcium diet is associated with preparation of the calcium homeostatic mechanism several days before the calcium demand of initiation of lactation.},

	abstract = {It has been demonstrated previously that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp) has potent vasodilatory and cardiac stimulatory properties. However, the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of PTHrp are unknown. In order to characterize these effects, we utilized the radioactive microsphere technique to examine the systemic and regional hemodynamics before and 2 min after the i.v. bolus administration of 0.03, 0.3 and 3.0 micrograms/ml/100 g b.wt. of PTHrp in conscious, unrestrained, normal rats. These effects were compared to those of synthetic rat parathyroid hormone (PTH), an agent known to affect cardiovascular function. PTHrp and PTH similarly and significantly decreased mean systemic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance but increased heart rate and cardiac output, all in a dose-dependent manner. Both peptides increased blood flow and decreased vessel resistance in regional vascular beds such as skin and heart. Renal resistance was reduced by PTH and PTHrp, but renal blood flow was not altered. Conversely, both peptides significantly decreased blood flow and increased vascular resistance to the splanchnic organs. Thus, PTHrp as well as PTH, preserved and enhanced cardiac function in the face of reduced systemic blood pressure while maintaining renal flow. These features are highly desirable in the treatment of some severe cardiovascular abnormalities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PTHrp may play an important hormonal, autocrine or paracrine role in systemic and regional blood flow regulation.},

There is also increasing concern that human breast cancer is principally epigenetic in origin and results from environmentally produced lesions. Little is known about the mechanisms by which toxic substances enter milk or mammary tissue but knowledge of these processes is important to toxicologists and researchers involved in drug design and metabolism. Five general pathways have been described for transport of proteins, lipids, ions, nutrients and water into milk. Four of these pathways are transcellular, involving transport across at least two membrane barriers; the fifth is paracellular and allows direct exchange of interstitial and milk components. Solute transport by these pathways is mediated by a diverse, and complex array of transport and secretory processes that are regulated by hormonal, developmental, and physiological factors. Current research is beginning to define the mechanisms underlying some of these processes, however the regulation and coordination of solute transport mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this article we review our current understanding of the normal solute transport and secretory processes involved in milk production, and discuss potential regulatory mechanisms.

Here it is shown that suckling results in both an elevation in serum PRL and the appearance of PTH-LP mRNA in mammary tissue. Bromocriptine, a potent inhibitor of PRL secretion, blocked the suckling-associated rise in serum PRL and the subsequent induction of PTH-LP mRNA in mammary gland. Furthermore, injection of PRL dramatically induced PTH-LP mRNA in unsuckled puerperal glands, but not in glands on day 21 of pregnancy. Thus, the correlation between serum levels of PRL and the expression of PTH-LP mRNA in mammary tissue extends the role of PRL in milk production and suggests a possible mechanism for the PRL effects on calcium metabolism.},

In this work, we generate a detailed quantitative picture of dynamic phosphorus stocks and flows, for both human and animal uses, from 1961 to 2013. During that half-century, total phosphorus consumption has increased fivefold, to 31 million metric tons (31Tg). However, losses and diversions from extraction to final consumption result in only about 22\% of the extracted phosphorus being actually consumed as human food. Agricultural practices have changed as well, with on-farm wastes yielding to manufactured fertilizers as the primary source of phosphorus. Non-food uses such as detergents and metal coatings were about five times larger in 2013 than in 1961, though they currently account for only about a quarter of all phosphorus use. Waste phosphorus flows to water, dominated by agricultural operations in 1961, have now been overtaken by loss from phosphate rock mining. Overall, the phosphorus cycle shows a history of inefficiency and loss, but also many opportunities for improvements that could lead to a much more sustainable situation going forward.},

	abstract = {SummaryThe calcium homeostatic mechanism was challenged in adult female rats by feeding them a calcium-deficient diet containing oxalate, and by subjecting them to pregnancy and lactation. The regimen caused a substantial weight loss, especially in those animals which reared their young well. Severe hypocalcaemia was observed in the lactating rats. Serum-P was slightly elevated. The content of hydroxyproline in serum was considerably elevated, reflecting the degree of calcium deprivation. Serum proteins were least influenced. The calcium depriving regimen reduced the growth of long bones, but did not stop it. The ash content of the bones was considerably reduced, the degree of reduction depended on the degree of calcium deprivation. Ash as percentage of total bone organ was reduced, but not to the same extent as total ash. Analyses of different parts of femur showed that the proximal and distal parts had lost more bone mineral than the diaphyseal shaft. The ash content of cortical bone tissue from the femur was estimated by a volumetric method. No differences were observed between test groups and controls, indicating that no measurable amounts of bone mineral had been removed from the walls of the vascular canals or by osteocytic osteolysis. Planimetric determinations on cross sections from femora disclosed that a great amount of bone had been removed from the endosteal surface of the diaphysis, while the periosteal surface demonstrated reduced bone apposition.},

	abstract = {Male mice lack mammary glands due to the interaction of circulating androgens with local epithelial-mesenchymal signaling in the developing mammary bud. Mammary epithelial cells induce androgen receptor (AR) within the mammary mesenchyme and, in response to androgens, the mesenchyme condenses around the epithelial bud, destroying it. We show that this process involves apoptosis and that, in the absence of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) or its receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PPR1), it fails due to a lack of mesenchymal AR expression. In addition, the expression of tenascin C, another marker of the mammary mesenchyme, is also dependent on PTHrP. PTHrP expression is initiated on E11 and, within the ventral epidermis, is restricted to the forming mammary epithelial bud. In contrast, PPR1 expression is not limited to the mammary bud, but is found generally within the subepidermal mesenchyme. Finally, transgenic overexpression of PTHrP within the basal epidermis induces AR and tenasin C expression within the ventral dermis, suggesting that ectopic expression of PTHrP can induce the ventral mesenchyme to express mammary mesenchyme markers. We propose that PTHrP expression specifically within the developing epithelial bud acts as a dominant signal participating in cell fate decisions leading to a specialized mammary mesenchyme.},

Futterverzehr, Verlauf der Lebendmasse, Milchleistung, Fortpflanzung und Verdaulichkeit der organischen Substanz wurden nicht signifikant durch den Gehalt von P oder Ca im Futter beeinflußt. Die Reduktion der P?Versorgung bewirkte im Blutplasma eine Senkung des Phosphat?Gehaltes und einen Anstieg des Calcium?Gehaltes, während die Verdoppelung der Ca?Versorgung ohne Wirkung auf beide Werte blieb. P? und Ca?Bilanzen wurden in 7 Phasen des Versuches bestimmt.

Most of the studies have been conducted with molasses feedblocks and liquid licks and the data indicate large day to day and among animal variation. A computer recording system has been developed and tested which allows for more information to be collected with regard to frequency of consumption of free-choice supplements by grazing animals. Studies have been conducted with molasses blocks and loose mineral supplements provided to grazing cattle. Results indicate that the supplements were consumed by almost all animals on a regular basis. However, there was considerable variation among animals in the quantity of supplement consumed. For the molasses blocks daily intake averaged 1.2 ± 0.6 kg per head within a range of 0.72–1.65 kg. For the mineral supplement the average daily consumption was 135 ± 55 g per head within a range of 50–300 g. The supplement feeders were visited every hour of the day but approximately 40\% of the visits occurred in the late evening. Information on the behavioural pattern of consumption may enable strategies to be developed which could reduce the variation in consumption.},

Some of the principles underlying the idea of “production disease” in dairy cows are illustrated by considering the metabolism of three pairs of mineral elements—sodium and potassium, calcium and magnesium, and copper and manganese. The quantitative data describing the “input”, “throughput” and “output” of these elements are presented, and their relationships both with known diseases, such as milk fever and hypomagnesaemia, and with less familiar conditions revealed by the Compton Metabolic Profile Test are discussed. The three pairs of elements, Na and K, Ca and Mg, and Cu and Mn, are used to exemplify situations in which input-output imbalances may occur with minerals which are completely, moderately and minimally available respectively from the diet. It is shown that for Na and K and Ca and Mg the period of lactation is most likely to cause such an imbalance, because other endogenous losses of these elements are small compared with their loss in milk. For Cu and Mn this is not the case because secretion of these elements in milk is small compared with their endogenous loss in faeces.},

Eight ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows with ad libitum access to a total mixed diet were assigned to one of four treatments as a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. All diets contained the same concentrate (50\%, DM basis) plus one experimental silage. The concentrations of Na, K, Ca, P, Mg, and S in the concentrate were .84, .71, .85, .78, .27, and 38\%, respectively. Dry matter intake was higher (P \&lt; .05) for cows fed alfalfa and barely silages than for cows fed oats and triticale silages (19.6, 18.6, 16.7, and 17.2 kg/d, respectively). Alfalfa silage contained a higher concentration of all minerals studied than the cereal silages, except Na. Sodium flow at the duodenum was substantially greater than dietary intake and apparent total tract digestibilities ranged between 74.5 and 85.2\%. Secretion of P in the forestomach ranged from 34 to 61 g/d and the major site of absorption was in the intestine. The correlation between P intake and fecal excretion of P was significant (P \&lt; .001, r2 = .39) and linear. Potassium absorption occurred before the duodenum and in the intestine. Apparent digestibilities of K were lower for cereal silages (range 74.0 to 82.9\%) than for alfalfa silage (88,7\%). Apparent total tract digestibilities of Ca (28 to 32\%), P(27 to 34\%), and MG (17 to 24\%) were similar for all diets so that Ca, P, and Mg absorption (g/d) reflected dietary Ca, P, and Mg levels.

	abstract = {This work reports the effects on growth and metabolic performance of steers fed 2 levels of phosphorus (P) during their repletion from a 15-week depletion period when they were fed diets containing various levels of nitrogen (N) and P. The repletion diets containing either 5·6 g P/day (marginal) or 8·3 g P/day (high) were fed to steers for a period of 12 weeks and were based on barley straw, molasses, sorghum grain, urea, and formaldehyde-treated gluten [mean dry matter (DM) digestibility of 0·62 and 14·6 g N/kg DM]. These repletion diets were formulated to simulate the dietary regimens of cattle grazing wet-season pastures in northern Australia and other tropical and subtropical regions. Food intake, liveweight gain, plasma metabolites, and P kinetics were measured. There was no significant difference between the repletion marginal- and high-P treatments in the mean liveweight (LW) gains and DM intakes (g/kg LW) of the steers. However, for both P treatments, the steers that had been fed a suboptimal level of N during depletion had marked increases ({\textgreater}60\%) in feed intake throughout the repletion period. Within the marginal-P treatment, the growth rates of steers that had been fed a suboptimal level of N during depletion were higher than for those that had been fed higher N levels, and were similar to those of the high-P groups. Plasma inorganic P, bone thickness, and bone P concentration remained lower for the marginal-P treatment at the end of the repletion period. Furthermore, within the marginal-P treatment, steers that had been fed the high-N diet during depletion were unable to increase bone thickness and had lower growth rates than anticipated for the quality of the diet. Although N balance was positive and similar for both P treatments, the apparent P balance for the marginal-P treatment of 7·6 mg/kg LW was only about half that of the high-P treatment. It was concluded that the requirement for dietary P in steers that had been exposed to a dietary P deficiency, particularly when in association with high N, was higher than the 5·6 g/day provided.},

	abstract = {Ice cream is consumed daily worldwide and yet its environmental impacts are scarcely known. This paper presents a first comprehensive life cycle assessment of market-leading vanilla and chocolate ice creams, considering both regular and premium products. The results suggest that their impacts are broadly similar across the 18 impact categories considered. For the majority of the impacts, chocolate regular ice cream is a slightly better option than the other varieties. Overall, the regular versions of the product have lower environmental impacts than the premium. Raw materials contribute most to the majority of impacts ({\textgreater}70\%). The exception is ozone depletion, which is mainly due to refrigerated storage at the retailer (95\%). The impacts are highly sensitive to the duration of storage and the type of refrigerant. Furthermore, the global warming potential of chocolate ice cream is very sensitive to land use change associated with cocoa beans cultivation, increasing the impact by 60\%. Considering annual consumption of ice cream in the UK, the total primary energy demand contributes to 3.8\% of energy consumption in the whole food sector while greenhouse emissions contribute 1.8\%. Future improvements in the supply chain should focus on milk and cocoa production, reduced storage time and types of refrigerant used. Product reformulation to reduce the amount of milk (fat) and sugar should also be considered, in line with the emerging health-driven market trends. In addition to industry and policy makers, the findings of this study will be of interest to consumers, enabling them to make better choices with respect to environmental impacts of most popular ice creams.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article was to rethink and resurrect Austin Bradford Hill's "criterion" of analogy as an important consideration in causal inference. In epidemiology today, analogy is either completely ignored (e.g., in many textbooks), or equated with biologic plausibility or coherence, or aligned with the scientist's imagination. None of these examples, however, captures Hill's description of analogy. His words suggest that there may be something gained by contrasting two bodies of evidence, one from an established causal relationship, the other not. Coupled with developments in the methods of systematic assessments of evidence-including but not limited to meta-analysis-analogy can be restructured as a key component in causal inference. This new approach will require that a collection-a library-of known cases of causal inference (i.e., bodies of evidence involving established causal relationships) be developed. This library would likely include causal assessments by organizations such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the National Toxicology Program, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, a process for describing key features of a causal relationship would need to be developed along with what will be considered paradigm cases of causation. Finally, it will be important to develop ways to objectively compare a "new" body of evidence with the relevant paradigm case of causation. Analogy, along with all other existing methods and causal considerations, may improve our ability to identify causal relationships.},

	abstract = {We show that non-classical measurement errors (NCME) on both sides of a regression can bias the parameter estimate of interest in either direction. Furthermore, if these NCME are correlated, correcting for either one alone can aggravate bias relative to ignoring mismeasurement in both variables, a ‘second best’ result with implications for a broad class of economic phenomena of policy interest. We then use a unique Ethiopian dataset of matched farmer self-reported and precise ground-based measures for both plot size and agricultural output to re-investigate the long-debated relationship between plot size and crop productivity. Both self-reported variables contain substantial NCME that are negatively correlated with the true variable values, and positively correlated with one another, consistent with prior studies. Eliminating both sources of NCME eliminates the estimated inverse size-productivity relationship. But correcting neither variable generates a parameter estimate not statistically significantly different from that generated using two improved measures, while correcting for just one source of NCME significantly aggravates the bias in the parameter estimate. Numerical simulations demonstrate that over a relatively large parameter space, expensive collection of objective measures of only one variable or correcting only one variable's NCME may be inadvisable when NCME are large and correlated. This has practical implications for survey design as well as for estimation using existing survey data.},

	abstract = {Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas where the science is well established. Conversely, historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals, and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active participants—the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.},

The test statistic is based on a direct estimation function for the variance of the overall treatment effect estimator. As outcome measures, the absolute and the standardized difference between means are considered. In simulation studies it is shown that the proposed test keeps the prescribed significance level very well in contrast to the commonly used tests in the fixed effects and random effects model, respectively, which can become very liberal. Furthermore, just for using the proposed test it is not necessary to choose between the fixed effects and the random effects approach in advance.},

	abstract = {Praise for the first edition: "The Handbook is a comprehensive treatment of literature synthesis and provides practical advice for anyone deep in the throes of, just teetering on the brink of, or attempting to decipher a meta-analysis. Given the expanding application and importance of literature synthesis, understanding both its strengths and weaknesses is essential for its practitioners and consumers. This volume is a good beginning for those who wish to gain that understanding." ―Chance "Meta-analysis, as the statistical analysis of a large collection of results from individual studies is called, has now achieved a status of respectability in medicine. This respectability, when combined with the slight hint of mystique that sometimes surrounds meta-analysis, ensures that results of studies that use it are treated with the respect they deserve….The Handbook of Research Synthesis is one of the most important publications in this subject both as a definitive reference book and a practical manual."―British Medical Journal When the first edition of The Handbook of Research Synthesis was published in 1994, it quickly became the definitive reference for researchers conducting meta-analyses of existing research in both the social and biological sciences. In this fully revised second edition, editors Harris Cooper, Larry Hedges, and Jeff Valentine present updated versions of the Handbook's classic chapters, as well as entirely new sections reporting on the most recent, cutting-edge developments in the field. Research synthesis is the practice of systematically distilling and integrating data from a variety of sources in order to draw more reliable conclusions about a given question or topic. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis draws upon years of groundbreaking advances that have transformed research synthesis from a narrative craft into an important scientific process in its own right. Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine have assembled leading authorities in the field to guide the reader through every stage of the research synthesis process―problem formulation, literature search and evaluation, statistical integration, and report preparation. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis incorporates state-of-the-art techniques from all quantitative synthesis traditions. Distilling a vast technical literature and many informal sources, the Handbook provides a portfolio of the most effective solutions to the problems of quantitative data integration. Among the statistical issues addressed by the authors are the synthesis of non-independent data sets, fixed and random effects methods, the performance of sensitivity analyses and model assessments, and the problem of missing data. The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis also provides a rich treatment of the non-statistical aspects of research synthesis. Topics include searching the literature, and developing schemes for gathering information from study reports. Those engaged in research synthesis will also find useful advice on how tables, graphs, and narration can be used to provide the most meaningful communication of the results of research synthesis. In addition, the editors address the potentials and limitations of research synthesis, and its future directions. The past decade has been a period of enormous growth in the field of research synthesis. The second edition Handbook thoroughly revises original chapters to assure that the volume remains the most authoritative source of information for researchers undertaking meta-analysis today. In response to the increasing use of research synthesis in the formation of public policy, the second edition includes a new chapter on both the strengths and limitations of research synthesis in policy debates},

	abstract = {Objectives
The adverse effects of cigarette smoking have been widely studied before, whilst the effects of hookah smoking has received less attention, although it is a common habit in the Middle East. Here we have investigated the effects of cigarette and hookah smoking on biochemical characteristics in a representative population sample derived from the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder (MASHAD) cohort study, from Northeastern Iran.

Study design
A total of 9840 subjects from the MASHAD population study were allocated to five groups; non-smokers (6742), ex-smokers (976), cigarette smokers (864), hookah smokers (1067), concomitant cigarette and hookah smokers (41).

Methods
Baseline characteristics were recorded in a questionnaire. Biochemical characteristics were measured by routine methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and p {\textless} 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
After adjustment for age and sex; the presence of CVD, obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM and dyslipidemia were significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) related to smoking status. After multivariate analysis, HDL (p {\textless} 0.001), WBC (p {\textless} 0.001), MCV (p {\textless} 0.05), PLT (p {\textless} 0.01) and RDW (p {\textless} 0.001), and the presence of CVD (p {\textless} 0.01), obesity (p {\textless} 0.001), metabolic syndrome (p {\textless} 0.05) and DM (p {\textless} 0.01) remained significant between cigarette smokers and non-smokers. Between hookah smokers and non-smokers; uric acid (p {\textless} 0.001), PLT (p {\textless} 0.05) and RDW (p {\textless} 0.05), and the presence of obesity (p {\textless} 0.01), metabolic syndrome (p {\textless} 0.001), diabetes (p {\textless} 0.01) and dyslipidemia (p {\textless} 0.01) remained significant after logistic regression.

Conclusion
There was a positive association between hookah smoking and metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia which was not established in cigarette smoking.},

Ten mature, non-lactating, non-pregnant, Holstein-Friesian-crossbreed cows received 2000 mEq of either one of the seven anionic salts tested, two combinations of the anionic salts or water as control via a rumen cannula. Salts and controls were assigned in a 10×10 Latin square design. Whole blood, serum and urine samples were taken during treatment (TP) and washout period. Samples of whole blood were tested for pH, base-excess and bicarbonate concentrations. In urine, pH and net acid-base excretion (NABE) were analysed. Calcium was measured in serum and urine. According to the different batches of hay, five groups of DCAD were created regarding cluster analysis. Changes in urine and blood parameters were statistically analysed for each DCAD group separately. The different DCAD had an impact on the amount of change in acid-base balance (ABB) and calcium metabolism and for how long these changes lasted. In the DCAD group receiving the highest amount of AS (239 mEq/kg dry matter with AS), changes of ABB were only noticeable in urine and these changes only differed from day zero in the first week of TP (P{\textless}0·05). In the other four groups changes of ABB were also visible in blood parameters, but only on a few days of TP did the deviations differ significantly (P{\textless}0·05) from day zero. Changes of ABB parameters in urine samples were more pronounced than those in blood and differed clearly from day zero (P{\textless}0·05). Parallel to the changes of ABB, calcium concentrations in these samples were significantly increased (P{\textless}0·001) in all DCAD groups. Except for the highest DCAD group, ionized calcium concentrations changed over time (P{\textless}0·020). However, the differences were very small and only differed from day zero on a few TP days. We conclude that the DCAD of a dairy cow's diet has an important impact on the effect of AS on ABB and calcium metabolism with respect to the duration and amount of change. The target regions of DCAD should be clearly below 100 mEq/kg dry matter to ensure the desired effect on ABB and calcium metabolism.

Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isonitrogenous, and supplied similar levels of P (0.46\%) and Ca (0.77\%). The salts, MgCl2, MgSO4, K2CO3, and NaHCO3 were used to alter DCAD. The main objective of the study was to ascertain whether a decrease in DCAD would reduce fecal P excretion in lactating dairy cattle. The experiment was conducted as a 4×4 Latin square design with 21-d periods. During the last 5 d, diets were offered at a restricted level and samples of blood, milk, feces, and urine were collected. Measures of acid-base status of the cows were linearly related to DCAD, but the animals did not experience metabolic acid stress. Neither fecal P nor urinary P was affected by DCAD, and there was no change in overall P balance. Plasma P tended to increase and blood concentrations of ionized Ca were enhanced as DCAD decreased; P excretion in milk showed a quadratic response to DCAD. Milk yield and milk composition were unaffected by changes in DCAD. Although DCAD may have influenced P homeostasis in lactating cows, there was no evidence that, within the range of + 14 to + 45 mEq/100g dry matter, DCAD could be used as a nutritional strategy to reduce manure P from dairy cattle.},

The low-calcium diet did not appear to affect adversely feed intake, milk production, or plasma ions. Depression of plasma calcium by sequestration with a chelating agent was less following low intake of calcium than following adequate calcium intake. Presumably, lower calcium intake increased parathyroid hormone which resulted in a larger and more responsive calcium pool immediately mobilizable. Changes in plasma phosphorus and magnesium were similar among treatments. Low calcium intake for short times apparently will not affect intake or production and may increase resistance to calcium stress such as hypocalcemia and parturient paresis.},

Those that fail can develop milk fever, a clinical disorder that is life threatening to the cow and predisposes the cow to a variety of other disorders. Less dramatic sub-clinical hypocalcemia can also reduce productivity of cattle by reducing feed intake in early lactation. The cause and prevention of milk fever will be discussed, focusing on the role of diet cation–anion difference and use of low calcium diets. The periparturient period also typically causes minor perturbations in blood potassium and phosphorus concentrations. Occasionally these disturbances are severe enough to be the cause of recumbency and the “downer cow” syndrome. Pathogenesis of these syndromes will be discussed. Low blood magnesium concentrations are observed when animals are fed inadequate amounts of magnesium or some factor is present in the diet, which prevents adequate absorption of magnesium. Severe hypomagnesemia can cause tetany and the downer cow syndrome, but more commonly moderate hypomagnesemia impairs the ability of the cow to maintain calcium homeostasis and hypocalcemia occurs secondary to the hypomagnesemia.},

	abstract = {Milk fever is a complex metabolic disorder that occurs at the onset of lactation. Clinical symptoms of this disease include inappetence, tetany, inhibition of urination and defecation, lateral recumbency, and eventual coma and death if left untreated. The hallmark of this disease is severe hypocalcemia, which probably accounts for most of the clinical signs associated with a milk fever episode. Several factors have been consistently associated with increased incidence of milk fever, including parturition and initiation of lactation, advancing age, breed, and diet. Of the various methods used in attempts to control the disease, the most progress has been made in dietary management. Until recently, most attention has focused on manipulating the levels of dietary calcium to control milk fever incidence; results, however, have been inconsistent, except for those diets containing very low (8 to 10 g/d) concentrations of Ca. During the past decade, there has been renewed interest and research in the use of dietary anions (Cl- and SO4(2-) in controlling milk fever. An outgrowth of this research has been the surprising realization that dietary K is significant (perhaps more significant than Ca) in determining the susceptibility of dairy cows to milk fever. This knowledge has expanded the understanding of the pathogenesis of milk fever and has focused attention on research designed to study methods for neutralizing the detrimental effects of dietary K excess on periparturient animal health. This report discusses various practical strategies and potential research areas for managing the dietary forage components to minimize the effects of K on milk fever incidence.},

Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anti-conservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

In the growth periods (starter, growth and finishing) chickens have received compound feed ad libitum with nutritional characteristics conforming to recommendations of the Aviagen Company. Broiler chickens and compound feed were weighed on each pen at: 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days, and was calculated: body weight gain (BWG), average daily gain (ADG) feed conversion ratio (FCR). Mortality was recorded daily. Thus, at the end of each growth period (14, 35 and 42 days), were calculated values for European Broiler Index (EBI) and European Production Efficiency Factor (EPEF). The highest values for EBI and EPEF were obtained at L1, and at LC situation was reversed. The economic efficiency of broiler chickens growth was positively influenced by the growth performance (BW, ADG and FCR) and the recorded viability. Although the genotypes studied were reared under identical condition, the hybrid „Cobb-500” had registered slightly higher values for two indices (P≤0.05), compared to the hybrid „Ross-308”.},

It also provides a good remedy for the multicollinearity problem, but its interpretation of input space is not as good. To overcome the interpretation problem, principal components (cluster components) are obtained through variable clustering, which was implemented with PROC VARCLUS. The procedure uses oblique principal components analysis and binary iterative splits for variable clustering, and it provides non-orthogonal principal components. Even if this procedure sacrifices the orthogonal property among principal components, it provides good interpretable principal components and well-explained cluster structures of variables. However, the PROC VARCLUS implementation is inefficient to deal with high-dimensional data. We introduce the two-stage, variable clustering technique for large data sets. This technique uses global clusters, sub-clusters, and their principal components.},

	abstract = {Some of the key mathematical results are stated without proof in order to make the underlying theory accessible to a wider audience. The book assumes a knowledge only of basic calculus, matrix algebra, and elementary statistics. The emphasis is on methods and the analysis of data sets. The logic and tools of model-building for stationary and nonstationary time series are developed in detail and numerous exercises, many of which make use of the included computer package, provide the reader with ample opportunity to develop skills in this area. The core of the book covers stationary processes, ARMA and ARIMA processes, multivariate time series and state-space models, with an optional chapter on spectral analysis. Additional topics include harmonic regression, the Burg and Hannan-Rissanen algorithms, unit roots, regression with ARMA errors, structural models, the EM algorithm, generalized state-space models with applications to time series of count data, exponential smoothing, the Holt-Winters and ARAR forecasting algorithms, transfer function models and intervention analysis. Brief introductions are also given to cointegration and to nonlinear, continuous-time and long-memory models. The time series package included in the back of the book is a slightly modified version of the package ITSM, published separately as ITSM for Windows, by Springer-Verlag, 1994. It does not handle such large data sets as ITSM for Windows, but like the latter, runs on IBM-PC compatible computers under either DOS or Windows (version 3.1 or later). The programs are all menu-driven so that the reader can immediately apply the techniques in the book to time series data, with a minimal investment of time in the computational and algorithmic aspects of the analysis.},

	abstract = {The term ‘repeated measures’ refers to data with multiple observations on the same sampling unit. In most cases, the multiple observations are taken over time, but they could be over space. It is usually plausible to assume that observations on the same unit are correlated. Hence, statistical analysis of repeated measures data must address the issue of covariation between measures on the same unit. Until recently, analysis techniques available in computer software only offered the user limited and inadequate choices. One choice was to ignore covariance structure and make invalid assumptions. Another was to avoid the covariance structure issue by analysing transformed data or making adjustments to otherwise inadequate analyses. Ignoring covariance structure may result in erroneous inference, and avoiding it may result in inefficient inference. Recently available mixed model methodology permits the covariance structure to be incorporated into the statistical model. The MIXED procedure of the SAS® System provides a rich selection of covariance structures through the RANDOM and REPEATED statements. Modelling the covariance structure is a major hurdle in the use of PROC MIXED. However, once the covariance structure is modelled, inference about fixed effects proceeds essentially as when using PROC GLM. An example from the pharmaceutical industry is used to illustrate how to choose a covariance structure. The example also illustrates the effects of choice of covariance structure on tests and estimates of fixed effects. In many situations, estimates of linear combinations are invariant with respect to covariance structure, yet standard errors of the estimates may still depend on the covariance structure.

Whether associative effects exist between energy nature and protein amounts is unknown. Therefore, ruminal isoenergetic infusions of low or high propionate mixtures were combined factorially with duodenal infusion of sodium caseinate or control. Four ruminally and duodenally fistulated Holstein cows were used. The diet was limited and consisted of 70\% forage and 30\% concentrate. Caseinate infusion increased milk yield and protein and casein contents and decreased milk fat content; curd yields and coagulation properties of milk were improved. The infusion of propionic acid caused a large increase in rumen propionate. Milk yield tended to decrease, and milk fat decreased, but protein, casein, and curd yields were unchanged; milk-coagulating properties were improved. No interaction existed between energy and protein amounts. Alteration of VFA had little effect on milk composition, but increasing the protein supply to the duodenum increased milk protein.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the consequences of a low supply of dietary Ca with or without a low dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) during early lactation on bone mobilization and reconstitution during lactation and on the dynamics of milk Ca content. Fifteen multiparous Holstein cows were distributed among 3 treatments 5 weeks before their expected calving date. These treatments differed based on the provision of diets through the first 10 weeks of lactation. During this period, the control treatment (NCa) consisted of a diet providing 100\% of the Ca requirement, with a DCAD of 200 mEq/kg dry matter (DM). The LCa (low Ca) and LCaLD (low Ca, low DCAD) treatments consisted of diets providing 70\% of the Ca requirement, with a DCAD of 200 and 0 mEq/kg DM, respectively. After 10 weeks, all cows received the same total mixed ration, which was formulated to meet 100\% of the Ca requirement. LCa and LCaLD tended to decrease the body retention of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation compared with NCa but affected neither the dynamics of the blood biomarkers of bone formation and resorption during lactation nor the body retention of Ca at 17 weeks of lactation. Cows almost entirely compensated for the decrease in Ca supply caused by LCa and LCaLD by increasing their apparent digestive absorption of Ca at 3 weeks of lactation, whereas their apparent digestive absorption was unaffected by the treatments at 17 weeks of lactation. Milk production tended to be lower throughout lactation with LCa and LCaLD compared with NCa, with a mean difference of 2 kg/d. The results of this study also indicated that measuring the dynamics of milk Ca content during lactation cannot be considered effective for indirectly estimating the dynamics of bone mobilization in cows. The results also suggested that limited Ca intake at the beginning of lactation may have deleterious effects on milk production.},

Two topics covered in the first editions (enzymes and other biologically active proteins) were transferred to Volume 1 of Advanced Dairy Chemistry and two new topics (water and physico­ chemical properties of milk) have been introduced. Although the constituents covered in this volume are commercially less important than proteins and lipids covered in Volumes 1 and 2, they are critically important from a nutritional viewpoint, especially vitamins and minerals, and to the quality and stability of milk and dairy products, especially flavour, milk salts and water. Lactose, the principal constituent of the solids of bovine milk, has long been regarded as essentially worthless and in many cases problematic from the nutritional and techno­ logical viewpoints; however, recent research has created several new possi­ bilities for the utilization of lactose.},

	abstract = {The charge to the committee (Institute of Medicine Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D and Calcium) was to assess current relevant data and update, as appropriate, the DRIs (Dietary Reference Intakes) for vitamin D and calcium. The review was to include consideration of chronic disease indicators (e.g., reduction in risk of cancer) and other (non-chronic disease) indicators and health outcomes. The definitions of these terms are discussed below. Consistent with the framework for DRI development, the indicators to assess adequacy and excess intake were to be selected based on the strength and quality of the evidence and their demonstrated public health significance, taking into consideration sources of uncertainty in the evidence. Further, the committee deliberations were to incorporate, as appropriate, systematic evidence-based reviews of the literature. Specifically, in carrying out its work, the committee was to: Review evidence on indicators to assess adequacy and indicators to assess excess intake relevant to the general North American population, including groups whose needs for or sensitivity to the nutrient may be affected by particular conditions that are widespread in the population such as obesity or age-related chronic diseases. Special groups under medical care whose needs or sensitivities are affected by rare genetic disorders or diseases and their treatments were to be excluded; Consider systematic evidence-based reviews, including those made available by the sponsors as well as others, and carefully document the approach used by the committee to carry out any of its own literature reviews; Regarding selection of indicators upon which to base DRI values for adequate intake, give priority to selecting indicators relevant to the various age, gender, and life stage groups that will allow for the determination of an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR); Regarding selection of indicators upon which to base DRI values for upper levels of intake, give priority to examining whether a critical adverse effect can be selected that will allow for the determination of a so-called benchmark intake; Update DRI values, as appropriate, using a risk assessment approach that includes (1) identification of potential indicators to assess adequacy and excess intake, (2) selection of the indicators of adequacy and excess intake, (3) intake-response assessment, (4) dietary intake assessment, and (5) risk characterization. Identify research gaps to address the uncertainties identified in the process of deriving the reference values and evaluating their public health implications.},

Although this standard approach has been invaluable up to the present, continued reliance on this approach to the exclusion of more complex, nonlinear methods may impede progress toward developing predictors that are reliable across unique individuals, times, and circumstances. To start, a discussion of the research hypothesis and its relationship to the partitioning of variance is presented. Attention is then shifted to the elements of a statistical test, followed by an examination of the selection perspective on research design and the distinction between inter- and intraindividual variability. A rationale for the use of multivariate, replicated, repeated-measures, single-subject designs in research with combat service members is offered. It is imperative to keep in mind that the most important aspect of any statistical test is the informed judgment of the researcher. As such, a clear understanding of these basic issues contributes greatly toward the appropriate design and analysis of experiments.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the effects of feeding diets with 2 dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) levels and supplemented with either cholecalciferol (CH) or calcidiol (CA) during late gestation on lactation performance and energetic metabolism in dairy cows. The hypothesis was that combining a prepartum acidogenic diet with calcidiol supplementation would benefit peripartum Ca metabolism and, thus, improve energy metabolism and lactation performance compared with cows fed an alkalogenic diet or cholecalciferol. Holstein cows at 252 d of gestation were blocked by parity (28 nulliparous and 51 parous cows) and milk yield within parous cows, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial, with 2 levels of DCAD (positive, +130, and negative, -130 mEq/kg) and 2 sources of vitamin D, CH or CA, fed at 3 mg per 11 kg of diet dry matter (DM). The resulting treatment combinations were positive DCAD with CH (PCH), positive DCAD with CA (PCA), negative DCAD with CH (NCH), or negative DCAD with CA (NCA), which were fed for the last 21 d of gestation. After calving, cows were fed the same lactation diet. Body weight and body condition were evaluated prepartum and for the first 49 d postpartum. Blood was sampled thrice weekly prepartum, and on d 0, 1, 2, 3, and every 3 d thereafter until 30 d postpartum for quantification of hormones and metabolites. Lactation performance was evaluated for the first 49 d postpartum. Feeding a diet with negative DCAD reduced DM intake in parous cows by 2.1 kg/d, but no effect was observed in nulliparous cows. The negative DCAD reduced concentrations of glucose (positive = 4.05 vs. negative = 3.95 mM), insulin (positive = 0.57 vs. negative = 0.45 ng/mL), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (positive = 110 vs. negative = 95 ng/mL) prepartum. Treatments did not affect DM intake postpartum, but CA-supplemented cows tended to produce more colostrum (PCH = 5.86, PCA = 7.68 NCH = 6.21, NCA = 7.96 ± 1.06 kg) and produced more fat-corrected milk (PCH = 37.0, PCA = 40.1 NCH = 37.5, NCA = 41.9 ± 1.8 kg) and milk components compared with CH-supplemented cows. Feeding the negative DCAD numerically increased yield of fat-corrected milk by 1.0 kg/d in both nulliparous and 1.4 kg/d in parous cows. Minor differences were observed in postpartum concentrations of hormones and metabolites linked to energy metabolism among treatments. Results from this experiment indicate that replacing CH with CA supplemented at 3 mg/d during the prepartum period improved postpartum lactation performance in dairy cows.},

Blood was sampled thrice weekly prepartum, and on d 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 postpartum to evaluate effects of the diets on vitamin D, mineral and bone metabolism, and acid-base status. Blood pH and concentrations of minerals, vitamin D metabolites, and bone-related hormones were determined, as were mineral concentrations and losses in urine and colostrum. Supplementing with calcidiol increased plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$, 3-epi 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$, 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{2}}$, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ compared with supplementing with cholecalciferol. Cows fed the diet with negative DCAD had lesser concentrations of vitamin D metabolites before and after calving than cows fed the diet with positive DCAD, except for 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{2}}$. Feeding the diet with negative DCAD induced a compensated metabolic acidosis that attenuated the decline in blood ionized Ca (iCa) and serum total Ca (tCa) around calving, particularly in parous cows, whereas cows fed the diet with positive DCAD and supplemented with calcidiol had the greatest 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ concentrations and the lowest iCa and tCa concentrations on d 1 and 2 postpartum. The acidogenic diet or calcidiol markedly increased urinary losses of tCa and tMg, and feeding calcidiol tended to increase colostrum yield and increased losses of tCa and tMg in colostrum. Cows fed the diet with negative DCAD had increased concentrations of serotonin and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen prepartum compared with cows fed the diet with positive DCAD. Concentrations of undercarboxylated and carboxylated osteocalcin and those of adiponectin did not differ with treatment. These results provide evidence that dietary manipulations can induce metabolic adaptations that improve mineral homeostasis with the onset of lactation that might explain some of the improvements observed in health and production when cows are fed diets with negative DCAD or supplemented with calcidiol.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study examined the hypothesis that interactions between bone and energy metabolism, particularly those involving osteocalcin, are present in dairy cattle and have feedback mechanisms over time. Associations between metabolites in blood were examined in 32 Holstein cows blocked by parity and milk yield and randomly allocated to diets containing either 0.27 mg/kg dry matter (DM) calcidiol or cholecalciferol for an anticipated intake of 3 mg/d (120,000 IU/d) at 11 kg of DM, and positive (+130 mEq/kg DM) or negative (−130 mEq/kg DM) dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) from 252 d of gestation to calving. Blood was sampled every 3 d, from 9 d prepartum to 30 d postpartum, and plasma concentrations of vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$, 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$, adiponectin, C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX1), glucose, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin, undercarboxylated osteocalcin (uOC), and carboxylated osteocalcin (cOC) were determined. Feeding calcidiol compared with cholecalciferol increased plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ pre- (264.2 ± 8.0 vs. 61.3 ± 8.0 ng/mL) and postpartum (170.8 ± 6.2 vs. 51.3 ± 6.2 ng/mL) but decreased concentrations of vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ pre- (1.2 ± 0.6 vs. 14.5 ± 0.6 ng/mL) and postpartum (1.9 ± 0.4 vs. 3.2 ± 0.6 ng/mL). Prepartum, cows fed the negative DCAD diet had reduced concentrations of vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ and glucose compared with cows fed a positive DCAD. The combination of negative DCAD and cholecalciferol reduced IGF1 concentrations prepartum. The DCAD treatment had no effect on postpartum concentrations of metabolites. Nulliparous cows had increased concentrations of OC, CTX1, IGF1, glucose, and insulin compared with parous cows. Time series analysis identified associations between metabolites on the same day and over 3-d lags up to ±9 d that suggest feedback between 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ and vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ in the negative lags, indicating that 25-hydroxyvitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ may exert feedback on vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ but not vice versa. We found evidence of a feedback mechanism between vitamin D$_{\textrm{3}}$ and IGF1, with positive effect size (ES) on the same day and 3 d later, and negative ES 9 d later, that was more evident in cholecalciferol-fed cows. This suggests an important role of IGF1 in integrating bone metabolism with energy and protein metabolic pathways. Evidence of feedback was found between uOC and particularly cOC with IGF1, with positive ES on the same day but negative ES 6 d before and 6 d after. An association between uOC or cOC and IGF1 has not been previously identified in cattle and suggests that both uOC and cOC may have marked biological activity. Associations between OC and insulin identified in mice were not observed herein, although associations between OC and glucose were similar to those between IGF1 and glucose, supporting associations between glucose, OC, and IGF1. We provide further statistical evidence of crosstalk between vitamin D compounds, bone hormones, and energy metabolism in cattle. In particular, associations between uOC or cOC and IGF1 may provide links between prepartum diets and observations of prolonged increases in milk production and allow better control of peripartum metabolism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our objective was to review the status of experimentation and data reporting in animal nutrition literature and to provide suggestions for the advancement of animal nutrition research and the ongoing improvement of field-applied nutrient requirement models. Improved data reporting consistency and completeness represent a substantial opportunity to improve nutrition-related mathematical models. We reviewed a body of nutrition research; recorded common phrases used to describe diets, animals, housing, and environmental conditions; and proposed equivalent numerical data that could be reported. With the increasing availability of online supplementary material sections in journals, we developed a comprehensive checklist of data that should be included in publications. To continue to improve our research effectiveness, studies utilizing multiple research methodologies to address complex systems and measure multiple variables will be necessary. From the current body of animal nutrition literature, we identified a series of opportunities to integrate research focuses (nutrition, reproduction and genetics) to advance the development of nutrient requirement models. From our survey of current experimentation and data reporting in animal nutrition, we identified 4 key opportunities to advance animal nutrition knowledge: (1) coordinated experiments should be designed to employ multiple research methodologies; (2) systems-oriented research approaches should be encouraged and supported; (3) publication guidelines should be updated to encourage and support sharing of more complete data sets; and (4) new experiments should be more rapidly integrated into our knowledge bases, research programs and practical applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review is to describe design and methodology of choice feeding experiments applied in ruminant livestock by taking into account their potential for different purposes and animal-, feed-, and set-up specific aspects. The first choice feeding experiments took place around 1900 with rats, but they were rarely conducted with ruminants until the 1950s. Choice feeding experiments can be used to assess the willingness of animals to ingest certain experimental feeds in a choice situation, i.e., when offering different feeds separately at the same time, thus determining their preference for, or the palatability of, different feeds. Choice feeding experiments help to improve our understanding of the feeding behaviour of animals, and may allow adjustment of management strategies to cover the nutritional requirements of the individual animal. Another application is for instance to test the animal's capability to cover their nutritional requirements, to avoid detrimental effects or to perform self-medication (i.e., to specifically select and ingest substances suitable to improve health and well-being). Choice feeding experiments can be conducted indoors or on pasture. The main target items to be determined in choice feeding experiments are proportionate intake, intake rate or feeding behaviour. Assessing the latter requires additional methods such as direct observations, automated recording systems or video recordings in order to assess for instance time spent feeding and switching frequency between the different experimental feeds. Sometimes secondary response variables (performance, milk or meat quality, metabolic profile, greenhouse gas emissions) are also recorded in choice feeding experiments with ruminant livestock. In this review important aspects and factors of influence to be considered in designing choice feeding experiments are discussed. Factors of influence are related to the animal itself, such as previous experience with the experimental feeds, adaptation processes, social influences or physiological stage. Feed-specific aspects include the form and number of experimental feeds offered in choice situations. Appropriate time schedules as well as advantages and disadvantages of short- or long-term choice feeding experiments are discussed. An important limitation of such experiments is that the results are only valid for the specific situation tested and any expectations for other situations have to be developed with care.},

That is, rather than using a univariate or a multivariate test statistic for analyzing effects, tests that assume a particular form for the covariance structure, the mixed model approach allows the data to determine the appropriate structure. Using the appropriate covariance structure should result in more powerful tests of the repeated measures effects according to advocates of the mixed model approach. SAS’ (SAS Institute, 1996) mixed model program, PROC MIXED, provides users with two information Criteria for selecting the ‘best’ covariance structure, Akaike (1974) and Schwarz (1978).

For example, prominent meta-analyses assessing the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior have reached apparently different conclusions, provoking ongoing debate. We suggest that such conflicts are sometimes partly an artifact of reporting practices for meta-analyses that focus only on the pooled point estimate and its statistical significance. Considering statistics that focus on the distributions of effect sizes and that adequately characterize effect heterogeneity can sometimes indicate reasonable consensus between “warring” meta-analyses. Using novel analyses, we show that this seems to be the case in the video-game literature. Despite seemingly conflicting results for the statistical significance of the pooled estimates in different meta-analyses of video-game studies, all of the meta-analyses do in fact point to the conclusion that, in the vast majority of settings, violent video games do increase aggressive behavior but that these effects are almost always quite small.},

	abstract = {Research in animal sciences, especially nutrition, increasingly requires processing and modeling of databases. In certain areas of research, the number of publications and results per publications is increasing, thus periodically requiring quantitative summarizations of literature data. In such instances, statistical methods dealing with the analysis of summary (literature) data, known as meta-analyses, must be used. The implementation of a meta-analysis is done in several phases. The first phase concerns the definition of the study objectives and the identification of the criteria to be used in the selection of prior publications to be used in the construction of the database. Publications must be scrupulously evaluated before being entered into the database. During this phase, it is important to carefully encode each record with pertinent descriptive attributes (experiments, treatments, etc.) to serve as important reference points for the rest of the analysis. Databases from literature data are inherently unbalanced statistically, leading to considerable analytical and interpretation difficulties; missing data are frequent, and data structures are not the outcomes of a classical experimental system. An initial graphical examination of the data is recommended to enhance a global view as well as to identify specific relationships to be investigated. This phase is followed by a study of the meta-system made up of the database to be interpreted. These steps condition the definition of the applied statistical model. Variance decomposition must account for inter- and intrastudy sources; dependent and independent variables must be identified either as discrete (qualitative) or continuous (quantitative). Effects must be defined as either fixed or random. Often, observations must be weighed to account for differences in the precision of the reported means. Once model parameters are estimated, extensive analyses of residual variations must be performed. The roles of the different treatments and studies in the results obtained must be identified. Often, this requires returning to an earlier step in the process. Thus, meta-analyses have inherent heuristic qualities.},
